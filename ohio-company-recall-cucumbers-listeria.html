According to the release, the potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination was discovered by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) through routine sampling.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the <a href=#>FDA</a>, when Listeria monocytogenes is eaten, “it may cause listeriosis, an illness to which pregnant women and their unborn children are very susceptible.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Symptoms of listeriosis could include fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea or upset stomach, headache, stiff neck, confusion, and loss of balance. Furthermore, pregnant women are about 10 times more likely to get listeriosis than other healthy adults.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Most of the time, pregnant women who are infected with listeriosis don't feel sick. However, they can pass the infection to their unborn babies without even knowing it.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So far, there have been no illnesses or consumer complaints reported in connection with the cucumber recall. The notice advised consumers to discard the products, which they added was already past their shelf life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Wiers Farm operates to the highest standards of health and food safety,” the company said in the notice. “We have taken immediate steps to address this isolated incident and we are collaborating closely with the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) to ensure a swift resolution.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s been a tough year for cucumbers. Last month, <a href=#>Fresh Start Produce Sales Inc. recalled</a> whole cucumbers shipped to 14 states from May 17 through May 21 because they may have been contaminated with salmonella. Eventual <a href=#>tests would yield</a> that some did indeed test positive for salmonella.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>You’re Not Imagining It: Food Recalls Are Getting More Common. Here’s Why</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the original notice from the <a href=#>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) released in early June, the agency said it had received reports of 162 people who had become sick with salmonella, connected to the recalled cucumbers, in 25 states and Washington, D.C., between <a href=#>March 11 and May 16</a>. Of those 162 people, at least 54 were <a href=#>hospitalized</a>, the CDC said.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, that statistic has risen to 449 people getting sick, though no deaths have been reported.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last week, <a href=#>a Florida woman, Melissa Milligan </a>filed suit against Fresh Start Produce Sales, as well as Bedner Growers Inc., which grew the cucumbers, over the salmonella outbreak, on allegations of strict liability, breach of warranty, and negligence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the <a href=#>complaint</a>, Milligan bought cucumbers at Publix Super Markets at Shoppes at Murabella in St. Augustine, Fla., on two separate occasions, and after eating the cucumbers,&nbsp; she started experiencing symptoms consistent with a <a href=#>salmonella infection</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the FDA’s <a href=#>latest update</a> on July 2, the agency shared results from their investigation into the salmonella outbreak, asserting that the same strand of salmonella causing some of the outbreak was also found in the untreated canal water used by Bedner Growers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They also said that the company’s cucumber season has ended and thus, “there is no product from this farm on the market and likely no ongoing risk to the public.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Get alerts on the biggest breaking news stories <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWluhHSAjqifoqddmLyuvMCnsGaqlZiurbiMnKycrZ2XsrO%2FjKWgrKyVp7aiew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
