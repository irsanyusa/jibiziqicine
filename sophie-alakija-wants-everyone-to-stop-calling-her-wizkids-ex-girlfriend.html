She made her frustration known during a scene from a reality tv series '<strong>Being In Nollywood</strong>.'</p><p>"For those of you that keep referring to me as Wizkid's ex-girlfriend, I have a name, my name is Sophie Alakija and I am an actress, not Wizkid's ex-girlfriend, I am somebody's wife at home," she said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Well, maybe she has a point because she is trying to become an actress with a name of her rather than being stereotyped. The last time we got to hear about Sophie was when she was involved in a car accident.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>Sophie Alakija survives car accident with family</h2></p><p>"God truly is amazing. We take life for granted oblivious to the fact that we can literally be gone any second.&nbsp;That’s my car, last night on our way home my family and I (my husband, myself and our 2 kids) were inside when 2 cars collided and ran into us. We literally spun a couple of times till we eventually stopped, facing oncoming vehicles. It was a horror as I thought my husband and first son were gone because the impact was on the side they both were.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"All 4 of us came out without a single scratch (Though alaxx’ old dislocation came off again and I’ve got whiplash and my head hasn’t stopped hurting but the doc says I’m all good). All I can say is I’m thankful for life because my life flashed before my eyes, it easily could’ve been a case of ‘RIP’ (God forbid). Just when I’m about to blow? How naaauuuu?! Help me thank God oh. May we never be victims!" she shared.</p><p>Sophie Alakija was known as <strong>Sophie Rammal </strong>back in the days before she got married, dated Wizkid for a while before getting married to <strong>Wale Alakija</strong>. They are blessed with two kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGasp6CdtqZ5wKWYpKGalnq4rc2tqmadppq%2FurvNnmStp12owbC8jJyYpaSZo7RutMSrZLChqqC2pb%2BMnq9mn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWeao394vsFp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
