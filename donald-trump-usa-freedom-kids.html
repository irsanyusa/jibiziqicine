Apologies for freedom — I can’t handle this! When freedom rings, answer the call!” <a href=# rel=noopener>they sang</a>, dancing in flag-bedecked dresses.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“On your feet, stand up tall! Freedom’s on our shoulders, USA! Enemies of freedom face the music. Come on boys, take them down!” they continued. “President Donald Trump knows how to make America great. Deal from strength or get crushed every time.” A video of the performance was shared widely on social media on Thursday.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Popick told TIME he was moved to write the tune after Trump announced his candidacy last June. “I’ve been a fan of his for decades. He’s got a great heart and a brilliant mind,” Popick said Thursday. “He has a methodology for success and winning that’s second to none. To me, he’s always just been an inspiration.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The 53-year-old businessman manages the girl group led by his 8-year-old daughter, Alexis. He said he had originally written the song in honor of Lt. General George Patton, who led the U.S. Army when it liberated Italy in World War II, but tweaked it to focus on Trump. “When I saw Donald Trump announce his candidacy and he talked about George Patton, I was just inspired to change it and make it a little more contemporary.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>How to Watch Tonight’s Republican Debate Online</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump said in his announcement speech that he wanted to find a military leader as great as Patton to tackle ISIS. “I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur. I will find the right guy,” <a href=# rel=noopener>he said at the time</a>. “I will find the guy that’s going to take that military and make it really work.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The girls entertained about 15,000 during Wednesday’s rally at the Pensacola Bay Center. They formed “USA Freedom Kids” about six months ago after Popick held a casting call to find its members. The group has since performed at Miami Dolphins’ and Miami Marlins’ games, singing the National Anthem. “They love it. They truly live for this stuff,” Popick said. “Every bit of it yesterday, it was a long day, but they absolutely stayed with it. Their energy was up. They loved meeting Donald Trump and performing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtaWhmgHl%2Fjp2mp5mcmXq1vtSmp2ato5Z6p77EnpuopV2gtqW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
