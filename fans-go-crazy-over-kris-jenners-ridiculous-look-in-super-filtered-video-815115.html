Notably, the author points out the unusual sight of&nbsp;Kris Jenner’s arms, which are typically kept covered, particularly in&nbsp;public.

However, instead of&nbsp;basking in&nbsp;the glow of&nbsp;Jenner’s beauty regimen, fans grappled with a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;confusion and disbelief. Rather than getting compliments and admiration, the video led to&nbsp;an&nbsp;unexpected discussion surrounding the extent of&nbsp;the filters and alterations applied to&nbsp;Jenner’s appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ba/183/c69fa85cc7afc2e53634bf3de0.jpg><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;era where photo-editing tools and filters have become ubiquitous, it’s not uncommon for celebrities and individuals to&nbsp;use such tools to&nbsp;enhance their online presence. However, in&nbsp;the Instagram post’s comments section, a&nbsp;common sentiment emerged as&nbsp;multiple users pondered whether the video was a&nbsp;product of&nbsp;<a href=# title=AI data-link=tag>AI</a> (Artificial Intelligence).</p><p>One follower wittily remarked, “The AI&nbsp;of&nbsp;Kris Jenner,” and others wrote, “Embrace your age. This filter is&nbsp;ridiculous.” But comments continued with remarks like, “What is&nbsp;happening that’s not her face!”</p><p>The way people reacted to&nbsp;the video shows that there’s a&nbsp;bigger discussion about how technology affects how we&nbsp;see things. But beyond the negative comments, some folks liked what she did, and they wrote something like: “Why add a&nbsp;filter? Kris is&nbsp;stunning. Wrinkles are not a&nbsp;bad thing, I&nbsp;promise.”</p><p>People have been questioning how Kris Jenner achieved her new look, but her family has dealt with <a href=#>critics</a> before. As&nbsp;the writer mentions, Kris’s youngest daughter, Kylie, recently shut down rumors about having extensive plastic surgery. Looking at&nbsp;how attractive the whole family&nbsp;is, it’s pretty clear that Kris’s genes have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;power.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLOiutJmnqhlk6euu8WMqK2eql2gv6q%2FjKOcp6aVp8BuvsidoJytnKTCtHnLqKakZZmjerTBz56pZp6ZocGmvsSdZK%2BhlJq8boSQbmhqbV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
