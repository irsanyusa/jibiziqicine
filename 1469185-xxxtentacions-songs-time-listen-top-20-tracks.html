Sad!</h3><p></p><p class=align-left><i>Sad!</i> is one of X's most popular hits. It is a deeply moving tune that evokes thoughts of isolation and melancholy. The artist expresses his sorrow and how he loved "her" but was eventually left alone. Fearing that his relationship with his lover could end, the singer goes the extra mile to threaten her that if she ever leaves him, he would commit suicide.</p><p class=align-left><i>Sad</i> is still one of the best XXXTentacion's song that is the most popular.

In addition, it reached number 19 on the UK Singles Chart.</p><h3>2. Look At Me!</h3><p></p><p class=align-left><i>Look At Me!</i> is a track mirroring the artist's disappointment. It's about a guy who can't seem to get his privates back into his pants. X emphasises <i>"Look at me, f*ck on me"</i> in the song, expressing regret. This isn't one of the best XXXTentacion's songs that is well-known, but it is a hit that brought him the attention he desired.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d1ee1025f7ade248.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The biography of Lil Reese: His age, net worth, and latest news</span></p></a><h3>3.

Hope</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>The vocalist brings hope to the bereaved and those who have lost loved ones in the song.

The song's narrators boast about their wealth and toughness.</p><h3>17. H20</h3><p></p><p class=align-left><i>H20</i> has a playful multi-part chorus and hyper-speed flows from X and Ski Mask The Slump God. It's probably best enjoyed live as its energetic beat and jumpy deliveries are meant for shouting more than anything else.</p><h3>18. Depression & Obsession</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>In the song <i>Depression & Obsession,</i> X seems very relaxed as he hums over supple strings and reflects on destructive relationships. He sounds all too familiar with his own pain.</p><h3>19. What in XXXTarnation</h3><p></p><p class=align-left>When it comes to X and Ski Mask's collaborations, you can always tell they are having a good time.
