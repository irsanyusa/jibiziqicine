The couple recently talked how their romance began on Dancing With The Stars and how Chmerkovskiy’s sweat practically won her over.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jenna-johnson-shares-how-she-first-met-husband-val-chmerkovskiy>Jenna Johnson Shares How She First Met Husband Val Chmerkovskiy</h2><p>During their appearance on The Squeeze podcast by Taylor Lautner and his wife, Tay Lautner, Chmerkovskiy and Johnson revealed how exactly they met on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a>. At the time, Johnson was 19 years old and a troupe member on the show.</p><p>“Everybody already knew each other and there’s like great energy with everyone and I’m like shaking and we randomly got partnered together in the routine that we were learning,” she said. “And this guy, just like, New York accent and he was like trying to flirt with me the whole time. And I was like, ‘Be professional, I don’t want to get fired on my first day!'”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chmerkovskiy</a> then responded, stating that he was only trying to be “kind and chivalrous.” According to the pro, he understood that Johnson was “probably intimidated” and thus, his responsibility to ease up the atmosphere.</p><p>“So you telling me how good your sweat smelled was [you just being] kind? He was like, ‘Know my sweat.’ I was like, ‘Oh my gosh who is this guy?’,” Johnson jokingly asked.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>In the same podcast, the Twilight star attempted to confirm if Chmerkovskiy’s sweat really did some wonders.</p><p>“Well, back in the day, he was doing [Aventus] Creed, but it was like 17 squirts of Creed. So, he would walk anywhere, a mile away, and I just like, ‘Val was here’,” she said.</p><p>While Chmerkovskiy admitted feeling their “physical chemistry,” he stated that love was something he wasn’t looking for then. The DWTS pro said he was “trying to find success” at the time.</p><p>The couple tied the knot in April 2019 Terranea Resort in Rancho Palo Verdes, California. In January 2023, they welcomed their first child, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rome Valentin Chmerkovskiy</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-duo-highlights-the-importance-of-drawing-professional-boundaries>The Duo Highlights the Importance of Drawing Professional Boundaries</h2><p>As workmates on DWTS, the couple knew they had to set healthy boundaries. When they were still getting to know each other, the couple was careful not to let their romance ruin their individual goals as dancers.</p><p>“Off-work, we weren’t sick of each other. We still wanted to hang out. We still wanted to kind of discover ourselves,” Chmerkovskiy said. “But you know, eventually, we had to make agreements, make arrangements, speak to each other because you know, I also didn’t sign up to be a duo when it comes to my work.”</p><p>According to Chmerkovskiy, it’s his way of respecting his relationship with his craft. This reasoning traces itself by the fact that the DWTS choreographer had a connection with dance before he met anybody.</p><p>“We met as individuals and individually graded our craft,” Johnson added. “So having to kind of figure out working together, dancing together, creating but then also being in a relationship, you just have to find boundaries.”</p><p>Chmerkovskiy recent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">win on DWTS</a> alongside Marvel star Xochitl Gomez marked his third Mirrorball victory. His first and second win was with Rumer Willis and Laurie Hernandez, respectively.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Original_CharliDAmelio_MarkBallas_Disney_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="Charli D’Amelio Vlogs Her Rehearsal with Mark Ballas for Special ‘DWTS’ Season 32 Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZ6lp5ldn7yputKopWaclamuqrjSZp%2Bor12rrq15wqGknqqbpMO0t8iyZJ%2BkmafBprCMsKCtoF2dsrN506GpqK2XnXqptdJmnqinlGLArrHLpaCnn12oxKat02g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
