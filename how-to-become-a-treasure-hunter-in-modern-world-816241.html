A&nbsp;treasure chest on&nbsp;a&nbsp;desert island. A&nbsp;treasure map and an&nbsp;unsolved cipher. The search for hidden jewels, adventures, fake trails, hidden clues, and fabulous wealth. All this can be&nbsp;found not only on&nbsp;the pages of&nbsp;adventure novels and in&nbsp;movies but also in&nbsp;real life.</p><p>Some people really make a&nbsp;living by&nbsp;looking for treasures and selling them for big money. The good news is&nbsp;that you can try it&nbsp;too. The bad news is&nbsp;it’s not as&nbsp;exciting as&nbsp;you might think.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a3a/211/2368165ceca837d792623181c2.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>So, to&nbsp;find precious stones or&nbsp;ancient gold necklaces, you first need to&nbsp;know where to&nbsp;look</u></a>. You can find information about such places on&nbsp;the Internet. And besides you, hundreds or&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;other people do&nbsp;the same, which reduces your chances of&nbsp;winning. Of&nbsp;course, cool treasure hunters know secret places and maps, but you’re a&nbsp;beginner, so&nbsp;try to&nbsp;look for gold here.</p><p>So, our first place is&nbsp;Crater of&nbsp;Diamonds, State Park, Arkansas. At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century, people first discovered diamonds here. Commercial companies tried to&nbsp;set up&nbsp;gemstone mining here but failed. In&nbsp;the 50s, this place became famous because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;15-carat shining stone called the Star of&nbsp;Arkansas found here.</p><p>This park has become a&nbsp;tourist attraction, where people still hope to&nbsp;find shiny stones. For all the time researchers have been digging the ground here, about 30,000 diamonds have been found. They find about 600 stones yearly, significantly improving their financial condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/257/494/51727b51a6bab83189af017a8d.png><p>The other location is&nbsp;in&nbsp;Bedford, Virginia. And here, you will have to&nbsp;work hard to&nbsp;find something valuable. There’s a&nbsp;legend that in&nbsp;1819, Thomas Beale and a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;men hid many treasures somewhere here that they had gotten in&nbsp;the western part of&nbsp;the country. The exact location of&nbsp;the treasure is&nbsp;unknown, but Thomas wrote a&nbsp;cipher that contains its coordinates.</p><p>He&nbsp;and all the others who knew the secret code passed away. And people are still trying to&nbsp;decipher the coordinates. One part of&nbsp;the cipher was solved, but it&nbsp;contained information about the contents of&nbsp;the treasure. Other parts of&nbsp;the cipher remain unsolved. Even though many consider this story fiction, cryptographers are still trying to&nbsp;unravel the cipher. Perhaps, you can do&nbsp;it.</p><p>Many people are looking for diamonds, gold coins, and jewelry. But what about something more unusual? What about jade? This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful semi-precious stone of&nbsp;mostly green color that you can find in&nbsp;Jade Cove, Central Coast of&nbsp;California. To&nbsp;get a&nbsp;big green stone, you need to&nbsp;scuba dive near the shore and look for it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the seabed. But if&nbsp;you’re lucky, you can find small jade pebbles on&nbsp;the beach after a&nbsp;storm or&nbsp;at&nbsp;low tide.</p><p>Remember that there are also sunken ships with priceless cargo besides natural gems and diamonds. One of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;the Spanish vessel San Miguel, which sank in&nbsp;1715, on&nbsp;the Atlantic coast of&nbsp;Florida, near Amelia Island.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dcc/e44/80ee2e566383d09afce4182864.png><p>The cargo price of&nbsp;this ship may be&nbsp;worth about $2&nbsp;billion, but the seekers managed to&nbsp;find only a&nbsp;tiny part of&nbsp;this treasure&nbsp;— hundreds of&nbsp;gold coins. Where the rest of&nbsp;the cargo is&nbsp;remains unknown. San Miguel is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the many ships that belonged to&nbsp;the Spanish cargo fleet.</p><p>Searchers were able to&nbsp;find other wrecks, but the location of&nbsp;San Miguel is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;mystery. You have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;find it&nbsp;but don’t waste too much effort. Even if&nbsp;you find the ship, you won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;take all of&nbsp;its jewels. The Queens Jewels salvage company owns a&nbsp;vast area where the boat sank. So, if&nbsp;you find something there, you’ll have to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;away to&nbsp;avoid problems with the law.</p><p>Okay, we&nbsp;found out the places where you can find treasures. Now it’s time <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>to&nbsp;prepare</u></a>. So, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;best to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;underground metal detector, <a href=# title=headphones data-link=tag>headphones</a>, a&nbsp;pinpoint, a&nbsp;sand scoop, and a&nbsp;good shovel.</p><p>The prices for metal detectors range from several hundred to&nbsp;several thousand dollars. You probably have an&nbsp;expensive device if&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;professional seeker with many years of&nbsp;experience. But if&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;beginner, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>this metal detector</u></a> for a&nbsp;little more than $138 will suit you. Put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Metal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Detector Carrying Case</u></a> and go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the treasure spot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2f0/2a6/2a31005421ba15ec233cc7e612.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Metal detectors have VLF</u></a>&nbsp;— very low-frequency technology. It&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;two coils that create an&nbsp;electromagnetic field. When an&nbsp;object conducting electricity enters the zone of&nbsp;this field, the detector field notices a&nbsp;small electromagnetic field of&nbsp;this object. Metal detectors catch the signal if&nbsp;a&nbsp;metal object is&nbsp;near the surface. But if&nbsp;the treasure is&nbsp;buried deep, you need to&nbsp;fork out for a&nbsp;more expensive device.</p><p>Also, a&nbsp;more expensive detector extends its effect to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wider range of&nbsp;metal types. When it&nbsp;finds someone’s electromagnetic field, it&nbsp;sends a&nbsp;signal you need to&nbsp;hear through highly sensitive<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u> headphones</u></a>, such as&nbsp;these.</p><p>Then, when you have detected the signal, you need to&nbsp;find its exact location. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, use a&nbsp;pinpointer. This thing works on&nbsp;the principle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;metal detector, but the area of&nbsp;its magnetic field is&nbsp;much smaller, which allows you to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;small coin or&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiny gemstone on&nbsp;a&nbsp;little plot of&nbsp;ground. And as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the pinpointer spots something, use a&nbsp;shovel to&nbsp;dig out the treasure.</p><p>Okay, you’ve arrived at&nbsp;the place and found the treasure with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;metal detector. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Don’t rush to&nbsp;rejoice because you can break the law by&nbsp;taking possession of&nbsp;the prize</u></a>.</p><p>There’s a&nbsp;vast set of&nbsp;laws concerning such finds. And it&nbsp;all depends on&nbsp;the country where you find&nbsp;it. Therefore, before you go&nbsp;somewhere, look at&nbsp;the rules in&nbsp;this country. Perhaps you will be&nbsp;banned from leaving the place with the found jewelry, and the customs will force you to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;all to&nbsp;the state. Or&nbsp;you could end up&nbsp;in&nbsp;jail. To&nbsp;avoid this, carefully study the rules.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/964/0f9/a8fef75556bd19c61cb62f6768.png><p>In&nbsp;some countries, if&nbsp;you find ancient jewelry or&nbsp;coins, you must give them to&nbsp;a&nbsp;local museum for study. Besides, there’s a&nbsp;rule called treasure trove. According to&nbsp;it, you can keep the jewels only if&nbsp;you find them on&nbsp;your land. But if&nbsp;the land belongs to&nbsp;someone else, the treasure must be&nbsp;divided between the owner and the one who found&nbsp;it. And you should not ignore these rules.</p><p>In&nbsp;2015, two guys discovered an&nbsp;artifact from the Viking age and didn’t tell anyone about&nbsp;it. They auctioned these old things, and the police imprisoned two guys for several years.</p><p>Any treasure found in&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK automatically belongs to&nbsp;the Crown. All states except Scotland must hand over the found artifacts to&nbsp;the King or&nbsp;Queen.</p><p>In&nbsp;the USA, the treasure-hunting system is&nbsp;much more complicated. The rules vary depending on&nbsp;the state. For example, you can own the found treasure only if&nbsp;there’s no&nbsp;official owner. But if&nbsp;you suddenly see a&nbsp;golden horse of&nbsp;the 19th century belonging to&nbsp;some Mr. Smith, then you will have to&nbsp;fight for the right to&nbsp;own the horse with the relatives of&nbsp;this Smith.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>In&nbsp;case of&nbsp;a&nbsp;found shipwreck</u></a>, you must first ensure that nobody owns it&nbsp;and is&nbsp;not looking for&nbsp;it. But not everything is&nbsp;so&nbsp;bad. If&nbsp;you find someone else’s ship, you’re entitled to&nbsp;a&nbsp;percentage of&nbsp;this treasure. This is&nbsp;called the law of&nbsp;salvage. It&nbsp;says that a&nbsp;rescuer or&nbsp;a&nbsp;seeker works to&nbsp;return lost items on&nbsp;behalf of&nbsp;the owner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/19a/305/b3e1225b63a3c15b5af64f94cc.png><p>And to&nbsp;pay the seeker for the work, the owner gives them a&nbsp;percentage of&nbsp;the value of&nbsp;the found valuable artifact. The rate depends on&nbsp;the risk the seeker took during the operation and the complexity of&nbsp;the searches.</p><p>The laws of&nbsp;Florida, for example, clearly state that everything you find in&nbsp;the water a&nbsp;few miles from the shore belongs to&nbsp;the United States. This applies not only to&nbsp;the ocean but also to&nbsp;lakes and rivers. It’s illegal to&nbsp;search for marine artifacts without special permission. Therefore, if&nbsp;you find some valuable wreck, you should report it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the Coast Guard.</p><p>Yes, the code of&nbsp;rules and laws doesn’t allow you to&nbsp;own everything you have found, but this doesn’t mean you can’t get rich.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ytpmaalZi8rrGMmmStqpWWwLa%2BxGafrqakmr9utc1mpKiclae7bsPOq6OdZWhmg3OAkGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
