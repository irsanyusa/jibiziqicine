The Masked Singer host has posted several back-to-back photos and videos with his children. This includes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most recent arrival</a> to the Cannon clan, son Zen with model Alyssa Scott.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cannon-posts-all-of-his-kids-on-instagram-after-years-of-not-sharing-family-photos>Cannon Posts All of His Kids on Instagram After Years of Not Sharing Family Photos</h2><p>If you take a look at Cannon’s Instagram feed, it pretty much features only clips from his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming daytime talk </a>show. He has never been one to share details of his personal life on social media, an approach that many celebrities take in the Instagram era. It seems like Cannon is changing up his mindset with these new posts.</p><p>In the first photo, Cannon holds his daughter Powerful Queen in a baby carrier strapped to his chest. His son, Golden Saigon that he also shares with Brittany Bell, stands nearby. Cannon and the kids shared a family day flying kites. He wore a neon green sweatsuit for the outing. He posted a second photo indoors holding Powerful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p>After these photos, Cannon posted a video of his twins <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zion and Zillion</a> that he shares with DJ Abby De La Rosa. The video is a behind-the-scenes look at their one-month photo shoot. Cannon placed headphones on the twins’ heads as they sat in front of mini DJ turntables. De La Rosa posted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>the final shots</a> over on her Instagram account. She cuddled up with Cannon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>in one photo</a>, further implying that the pair are dating.</p><p>Cannon’s next Instagram story featured a photo of Zen who was born on June 23. Scott also shared <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>a photo cradling the newborn</a> on her Instagram account. Cannon posted a couple of other shots of his children including a visit from twins Monroe and Moroccan that he shares with Mariah Carey.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-post-pics-of-the-kids-now>Why Post Pics of the Kids Now?</h2><p>Cannon received quite a bit of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">flack on social media</a> after welcoming four children in the span of a year. Many wondered if he intended on having so many children. The memes, gifs, and mean tweets just kept on coming in Cannon’s direction. This prompted Cannon to speak out on July 7 about fatherhood once and for all.</p><p>“I’m having these kids on purpose,” he said on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his Power 106 radio show.</a> “I didn’t have no accident.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Samantha-small.png><p>Cannon also said there were “a lot of people that I could’ve gotten pregnant that I didn’t.” When he went on The Wendy Williams Show back in 2019, Cannon gushed about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">having more kids in the future.</a> In 2017, Cannon also stopped by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Howard Stern Show</a> to talk about how his Lupus diagnosis made him want to embrace life and have more children.</p><p>Having a big family has always been a goal of Cannon’s. It now looks like he is into sharing a little bit more of his life with the world. His life will always be under a microscope and it’s really his decision to choose what to share on social media. The same is the case with all of the mothers of his children who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">share glimpses into their lives</a> on social media sometimes.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/thumbnail_photoByKevinWinter-TodayInNashville_GettyImages-Youtube.jpeg alt="‘Songland’s Greg Scott Says His Olympic Anthem Was Booted for Jonas Brothers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Nick Cannon</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKapGWTlruvu81mqqKklaOwpr%2BMramopJyoeqPFjKmmrKyZo7RuvMeoq6irXaSzbq3LpWSsnaaau26vx6KjnaqVo3qwuoyipayskZy%2FormO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
