It&nbsp;turns out that sometimes fake <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> looks very real and sincere, and it&nbsp;can last for decades until you realize the person you’ve been calling your friend is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;foe. In&nbsp;this thread, Redditors opened up&nbsp;about what made them realize their friendships were elusive, and those life lessons are truly precious.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> selected 23&nbsp;stories people shared in&nbsp;this thread, and they explain, in&nbsp;detail, what “fake” friends say and&nbsp;do.</p><p><h2>They need you only when they need something you can do&nbsp;or&nbsp;give.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/270/77e/aa3b88510c93131c93cf80f9dc.jpg><ul><li>When I&nbsp;was babysitting her kids, things were going great. We&nbsp;would hang out all the time, have movie nights, and just talk and chill. But the second she no&nbsp;longer needed a&nbsp;babysitter was the second&nbsp;I got kicked to&nbsp;the curb. No&nbsp;explanation, not even a&nbsp;text back. Some people will act like your best friend until they no&nbsp;longer need you. Their loss though. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@Idgiethreadgoode86/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;was invited to&nbsp;the bachelorette party for one of&nbsp;the friends in&nbsp;this group. While at&nbsp;the party, I&nbsp;figured out that&nbsp;I was the only person not invited to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a>. I&nbsp;had been invited to&nbsp;the party because they needed another person to&nbsp;chip in&nbsp;for expenses. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@littled311/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;slowly realized&nbsp;I was only around for chores and errands&nbsp;— rides to&nbsp;the airport, picking up&nbsp;furniture, helping them move. Anything social always resulted in&nbsp;either last-minute cancellations, showing up&nbsp;45&nbsp;minutes late, and bolting after 10&nbsp;minutes. I&nbsp;thought they were busy, but&nbsp;no. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@gelatinous_p***/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;traded in&nbsp;my&nbsp;truck for a&nbsp;smaller, more eco-friendly vehicle. <a href=# title=Communication data-link=tag>Communication</a> plummeted now that&nbsp;I couldn’t haul furniture around, assist with moving, dispose of&nbsp;garbage, etc. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@mandox1/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>One friend stopped replying to&nbsp;my&nbsp;texts right after we&nbsp;graduated from college. Like, the same week we&nbsp;graduated. So...I was pretty much just a&nbsp;study buddy that they kept close to&nbsp;keep me&nbsp;helping them. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@ts1985/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mechanic, and it’s staggering how many people were friends because they needed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;fix things for them. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@T***T***M***/Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>They oust you from their group.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a6/678/be1d9c5f4fbfafbdde3edac636.jpg><p>I know what this is like</p><ul><li>They stopped inviting me&nbsp;to&nbsp;hang out. They would ask me&nbsp;to&nbsp;drive them to&nbsp;parties, but not invite me&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the parties. They basically ghosted me&nbsp;for a&nbsp;while. They were once such amazing and important friends, but they gradually became really arrogant. It&nbsp;took way longer than it&nbsp;should have to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;and find other people. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@D***_By_Pun/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;my&nbsp;Xbox 360&nbsp;a friend was borrowing, and our whole group of&nbsp;friends was there. They had spent the entire day playing games with snacks and pizza, and&nbsp;I had not been invited. And now&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;the situation of&nbsp;being the one who takes the ball home and ruins the fun for everyone. I&nbsp;took my&nbsp;Xbox and never spoke to&nbsp;anyone in&nbsp;that group again. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@zenchemin/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;wouldn’t say&nbsp;I have fake friends, but I&nbsp;am definitely the periphery friend. The majority of&nbsp;the time, if&nbsp;there aren’t enough tickets or&nbsp;space in&nbsp;the car for everyone to&nbsp;go&nbsp;do&nbsp;something, I’m the one who gets cut out. It&nbsp;doesn’t bother me&nbsp;much but&nbsp;I wish they would be&nbsp;more mindful when talking to&nbsp;me&nbsp;about “things we&nbsp;have done.” “Remember when we&nbsp;went to&nbsp;see X? Wasn’t that fun?” Well, no&nbsp;because&nbsp;I wasn’t invited. In&nbsp;those situations, it&nbsp;usually gets awkward or&nbsp;they say, “Hey, we&nbsp;would have invited you if&nbsp;we&nbsp;had the tickets, space, etc.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@Moeb***90/Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>They don’t really care about you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/16c/adb/045f8a59c89d160cee8a0238c3.jpg><ul><li>My&nbsp;best friend of&nbsp;10&nbsp;years called on&nbsp;my&nbsp;wedding day to&nbsp;say she couldn’t make it&nbsp;because she was just so&nbsp;sad about her recent <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>. Turns out she just had a&nbsp;date. Our whole friendship was fake, it&nbsp;just took me&nbsp;to&nbsp;that point to&nbsp;realize&nbsp;it. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@pudgywombat/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;realized my&nbsp;friends were fake ones when my&nbsp;phone got stolen and&nbsp;I lost their phone numbers. Mine stayed the same, but we&nbsp;just never talked again. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@maddallena/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>The group made plans to&nbsp;meet and hang out. I&nbsp;was getting ready at&nbsp;the salon. A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;friends had to&nbsp;back out for some reason. The other friend then made excuses of&nbsp;his own, and&nbsp;I could tell. I&nbsp;tried cajoling him and offered ways for him to&nbsp;go, but he&nbsp;basically decided to&nbsp;cancel the entire group meet-up. It&nbsp;was my&nbsp;<a href=# title=birthday data-link=tag>birthday</a>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@TeaTreeTreatly/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>Whenever we&nbsp;were supposed to&nbsp;hang out, something came&nbsp;up, and that “something” was hanging out with other mutual “friends.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@Ashii_nix/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;realized&nbsp;I was the one always calling. Then I&nbsp;stopped and the “friends” disappeared. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@JohnnyJayce/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>When you try to&nbsp;open up&nbsp;and share a&nbsp;genuine conversation about something going on&nbsp;in&nbsp;your life and all they can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;crack <a href=# title=jokes data-link=tag>jokes</a> and try to&nbsp;get you to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out with them. It&nbsp;made me&nbsp;realize how surface-level many “friendships” really are. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@BrotherOfTheOrder/Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>They talk behind your back.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/737/3c8/e3c88d52c29d33caccc1acb009.jpg><p>Wist je dat nog niet?.?</p><ul><li>When I&nbsp;started seeing my&nbsp;other friend’s attitude changing, I&nbsp;asked him what was happening and he&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that a&nbsp;girl that&nbsp;I thought was my&nbsp;best friend said things about me&nbsp;behind my&nbsp;back. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@slightlyMuster747/Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>They hang out with you while you’re happy and successful but never show up&nbsp;when you need help.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f5/d8d/316c1853fc8ea7beced75ca4bf.jpg><ul><li>I&nbsp;was recently excluded from a&nbsp;party where my&nbsp;friends got on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bus to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out of&nbsp;town. The “friend” who had the party said that they didn’t invite me&nbsp;because “There was not enough space on&nbsp;the bus.” @<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Churchofbabyyoda/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;realized my&nbsp;friends were fake when&nbsp;I went through a&nbsp;divorce and was down to&nbsp;just $700. That was the most difficult period, and&nbsp;I weeded out all those who “friended” me&nbsp;for my&nbsp;generosity because&nbsp;I was well-off. I&nbsp;started over and have, like, 2&nbsp;truly good friends. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@allens969/Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>They abandoned me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I was going through a&nbsp;rough time after I’d spent years listening and supporting them. When I&nbsp;had my&nbsp;first true moment where&nbsp;I was coping and needed support, they were nowhere to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen. That’s when&nbsp;I realized my&nbsp;high school friends never had grown up&nbsp;past high school. Luckily, I&nbsp;had other friends, just not a&nbsp;large girl group like that. But I&nbsp;can actually say that every friend&nbsp;I have&nbsp;I know has my&nbsp;back and won’t judge me&nbsp;if&nbsp;I’m not always happy. And the same goes for&nbsp;me. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>@LizFrance/Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Have you ever realized that you were dealing with “fake” friends?
