A guide to look-alike words</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>If you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">study English</a>, then surely you’ve come across confusing words. In English there are many <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grammar rules</a> that seem to have endless exceptions! Have you encountered words that are spelled the same but have a different meaning? And are they pronounced differently as well? These words are called heteronyms.&nbsp;</p><p>This article will describe heteronyms, give examples and discuss some similar <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grammatical word forms</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-is-a-heteronym?>What is a heteronym?</h2><p>Heteronyms are words that are <a href=#>spelled the same</a>, but have different meanings and different <a href=#>pronunciations</a>. In English, most heteronyms come in pairs. Here is an example:</p><li>The couple got into a big <strong>row </strong>last night.&nbsp;</li><p>In this sentence, <strong>row </strong>means an argument. This is the pronunciation /rau/ and it rhymes with cow.&nbsp;</p><li>We had to <strong>row </strong>the boat for hours to get back to shore.&nbsp;</li><p>In this sentence, <strong>row </strong>means to use oars to move a boat. This is the pronunciation /rō/ and it rhymes with go.&nbsp;</p><p>These words are clearly confusing! The word <strong>row </strong>is spelled the same in each sentence. But the meaning is completely different and the pronunciation is different. As you get better at English, you will recognize the right word to say based on context.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Heteronym examples</h2><p>Now that we know the definition of a heteronym let’s take a look at a list of heteronyms.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th><strong>Heteronym</strong></th><th><strong>Definition, usage and pronunciation 1</strong></th><th><strong>Definition, usage and pronunciation 2</strong></th></tr><tbody readability=23.5><tr readability=5><td>Bass</td><td>A stringed instrument, type of guitar:<br>He plays the <strong>bass</strong>.<br>/bās/</td><td>A type of fish:<br>They go fishing for <strong>bass</strong>.<br>/bas/</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Bow</td><td>A tool used to shoot an arrow at a target:<br>The kids practiced using a <strong>bow </strong>and arrow at camp.<br>/boh/</td><td>To bend the upper part of the body as a greeting or sign of respect:<br>In Japan, it is respectful to <strong>bow </strong>when greeting people.&nbsp;<br>/bou/</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Close</td><td>Cover an opening:<br>Will you <strong>close </strong>the door?&nbsp;<br>/klohz/</td><td>Near:<br>The store is <strong>close </strong>to the school.&nbsp;<br>/kləʊs/</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Desert</td><td>To leave or abandon:<br>Did he <strong>desert </strong>his wife?<br>/dih-zurt/</td><td>A dry, barren area of land:<br>The Sahara <strong>desert </strong>is in northern Africa.<br>/dez-ert/&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Lead</td><td>To show someone the way:<br>I am going to <strong>lead </strong>the group trip in Mexico.&nbsp;<br>/leed/</td><td>A type of metal:&nbsp;<br><strong>Lead </strong>paint is banned in many countries.&nbsp;<br>/led/</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Live</td><td>To reside:<br>I <strong>live </strong>in Chicago.&nbsp;<br>/liv/</td><td>In the moment, in person:<br>I like listening to <strong>live </strong>music.<br>/lahyv/</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Object</td><td>To express disagreement:<br>It is common for a lawyer to <strong>object </strong>to the argument from the other side.&nbsp;<br>/əbˈdʒɛkt/</td><td>A material thing:<br>The museum had an interesting <strong>object </strong>on display.&nbsp;<br>/ob-jekt/</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Refuse</td><td>Garbage:<br>After the party there was a ton of <strong>refuse</strong>.&nbsp;<br>/ref-yoos/</td><td>To indicate an unwillingness to do something:<br>I <strong>refuse </strong>to answer your questions.&nbsp;<br>/ri-fyooz/</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Tear</td><td>To rip or pull apart:<br>If you <strong>tear </strong>the paper in half you will have two pieces of paper.&nbsp;<br>/tair/</td><td>A drop of liquid in the eye:<br>I always cry a <strong>tear </strong>of happiness when I watch romantic movies.&nbsp;<br>/teer/</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Wind</td><td>The natural movement of air:<br>The <strong>wind </strong>is strong at the top of the mountain.&nbsp;<br>/wind/</td><td>To change direction, bend or turn:<br>The road seems to <strong>wind </strong>through the mountains.&nbsp;<br>/wahynd/</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the difference between homonyms and heteronyms?</h2><p>Let’s review another <a href=#>grammar</a> form similar to heteronyms.&nbsp;Remember, heteronyms are words that are spelled the same, have different meanings, but are pronounced differently. Homonyms are words that are spelled the same, have different meanings, but are pronounced the same.</p><p>Here are some common homonyms used in example sentences:</p><p>Can I borrow your <strong>pen </strong>to sign my name? (Writing utensil that uses ink.)</p><p>The farm animals live in a <strong>pen </strong>so they do not escape. (Small fenced-in area.)</p><p>I am reading a great <strong>book</strong>. (A printed publication bound in a cover.)</p><p>Did you <strong>book </strong>the hotel room for our vacation? (Reserve.)</p><p>I broke my <strong>arm </strong>when I fell out of the tree. (Upper limb of the human body.)</p><p>I work for the New York <strong>arm </strong>of the company. (A division of a company.)</p><p>The child is very <strong>bright</strong>. (Smart.)</p><p>My new apartment is very <strong>bright</strong>. (Sunny.)</p><p>What <strong>kind </strong>of food would you like for dinner? (Type.)</p><p>My cousin is so <strong>kind </strong>to everyone. (Nice.)</p><p>They love <strong>rock </strong>music. (Rock and roll.)</p><p>The <strong>rocks </strong>in the river are smooth. (Hard mineral deposit.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is it live or live?&nbsp;</h2><p>If you desert (abandon) your English studies, your language skill will become like the desert (a dry area of land without much life or vegetation). If you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">enjoy learning English</a>, homonyms and heteronyms will be fun for you. With practice, you will know the difference between I live<strong> </strong>in Chicago (the city) and listen to live<strong> </strong>music by the Chicago (the band).</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
