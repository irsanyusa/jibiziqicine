Meanwhile, Mickelson’s net favorability rating dropped from 62 percentage points to 48 percentage points, marking the biggest decline for any golfer included in both surveys.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Some experts cautioned that Mickelson’s drop in popularity might not be totally connected to his controversial comments and decision to join the Saudi-backed league.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The decline of Mickelson’s on-course performance (he currently ranks No. 89 in the world) and fans’ lack of familiarity with LIV Golf could be contributing factors, said Eric Pliner, chief executive officer of global strategy and leadership consulting firm YSC Consulting. Still, it’s clear that Mickelson’s choices have not helped his standing among fans. On the other hand, McIlroy may have endeared himself further by standing up for the PGA.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Fans and consumers of all kinds appreciate and trust people that say what they stand for and what they won’t stand for,” said Pliner of McIIroy. “When he comes out and says, ‘This is not OK. I support the PGA Tour. I am aligned to the PGA Tour, and these are the reasons,’ fans appreciate the clarity and directness of that message.”</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>LIV’s uphill battle&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Morning Consult data found that 16% of PGA Tour fans said they watched the inaugural LIV Golf event in London from June 9-11. When analyzing viewership by demographic, just over 1 in 10 Gen Zers (13%) said they watched the competition, good for the top spot among all demographics.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">LIV Golf live streams coverage in the United States on Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook, Google’s YouTube and its own website, in addition to sports streaming service DAZN. Viewership has been modest through two events, and executives agreed that LIV Golf must put its programming where sports fans are already accustomed to watching.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“If I was LIV Golf, my first priority would be to ensure the greatest amount of eyeballs, and until they get a substantial U.S. television deal, that’s going to be holding them back,” said Ellen Zavian, a sports industry veteran and professional lecturer at George Washington Law School.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Steve Patterson, president of Pro Sports Consulting and former senior executive with the Arizona Coyotes and Portland Trail Blazers, echoed Zavian’s statement. He noted that the “tipping point” for LIV Golf is when the property gets “enough distribution on traditional channels like network, cable and streaming that it starts to operate and look more like a business in the traditional sense.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Are there then sufficient sponsors to support that and who want to have their brand associated with a thugocracy?” Patterson added. “That's a tough putt.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Some executives acknowledged that LIV Golf is fighting an uphill battle in a sport that is known for its long-standing traditions. In order to generate awareness and attract more interest, the series needs to go beyond signing the world’s top golfers, they said.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Ganis suggested further emphasizing some of the series’ innovations, like providing a more intimate level of access to players via more microphones and experimenting with how the new league is presented on broadcast. He also said it should investigate how to become more gambling friendly —&nbsp;states and sportsbooks in the United States have thus far implemented <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>varied strategies</a> with LIV Golf.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">On-screen graphics keep fans updated in real-time on all 48 golfers’ positions, similar to a NASCAR race. LIV Golf has also leveraged drone technology and mobile steady cameras for its broadcasts.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Syracuse’s Burton suggested that LIV Golf should act as counterprogramming to the PGA Tour, staging its bigger events during the Tour’s weaker tournaments to attract fans who want to watch the best competition.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“These two competitors are now in a duel to see who will be the most efficient at presenting professional golf,” Burton said. “Over the next couple of years, it will start to become very obvious who is doing a better job.”&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In the meantime, Ganis said that LIV Golf is “going to need to be happy with a niche for the foreseeable future” as the Saudis assess how to further allocate their immense financial resources.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“We will find out if the Saudi money will be there at the same order of magnitude for a niche sport three years from now,” he said. “If you ask me, 10 years from now, ‘which of these two organizations are likely to be operating in a major way?’ I’ll say it’s the PGA Tour.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZMGzsc2dZKydpKmys7%2BOpaCvZZekuad5z6CYZqyfqr9uvMeio2almZi4prjSqKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
