One of his biggest statements: his choice of attire. The <a href=#>Man of the Woods</a> singer and <a href=#>three-time Super Bowl performer</a> started things out in camo-print pants, a shirt emblazoned with a landscape (including a deer), a fringed leather jacket, a red bandana around his neck and special edition Nike Air Jordans. It was an eclectic mashup of styles that had many scratching their heads — and others nodding to his latest album title to understand his inspiration.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His dance-heavy performance, which saw him bringing back past hits like “Mirrors” and “Cry Me a River,” mixing in <a href=#>new single “Filthy”</a> and singing a duet with a projection of Prince, was filled with props and even a costume change when he swapped his leather jacket for a matching camo suit blazer. (That was for “Suit and Tie,” naturally.) But the outfit really got the internet joking. The look has high fashion bona fides, as it was custom designed for Timberlake <a href=# rel=noopener>by Stella McCartney</a>. Yet there were still plenty of hot takes to be had on Twitter.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I like to think Justin Timberlake was like, “I’m going to the Midwest. Better wear a camo suit, elk shirt and a bandana so I fit in. That’s what they wear, right?” And no one told him no.</p>— Megan Raposa (@mlraposa) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Justin Timberlake has on a camo suit jacket, a blaze orange t-shirt, carhart style stocking cap, and logging boots. It’s like he grabbed a Minnesota starter kit at the airport.</p>— chaddaniels (@thatchaddaniels) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm still thinking about how Justin Timberlake wore a windowpane and camo patterned suit over a print button up with a red bandana tied around his neck for his halftime show.</p><p>It seems he is destined for wardrobe malfunctions.</p>— Sabrina (@NerdyAndQuirky) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Great to see JT represent last night. But to set the record straight for the coastal elites, Midwesterners only wear their state-issued camo suits, elk shirts, and bandanas for special occasions -- like a barn raising, a victorious squirrel hunt, or performing at the Super Bowl. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GyBmNzLXv3</a></p>— Brent Beshore (@BrentBeshore) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>When this game is long gone,we we always remember the camo suit jacket....</p>— James Vincent McMorrow (@jamesvmcmorrow) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And then there was the Bob Ross take.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaWNof3aDjqOsrKyZo3q1tcybnKukkaCybr%2FUqZyrmp%2BsuW671K2doqxdorKusY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
