In&nbsp;real life, they had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same. The 2&nbsp;years they spent together were driven by&nbsp;the love and respect they shared in&nbsp;real life. And they’ve managed to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;<a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> that runs deep and is&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tight as&nbsp;ever, </a>even long after their breakup.</p><p><h2>Kaley Cuoco had a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;Galecki early&nbsp;on.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/686/28b/e668f55547b1463c8bca099ae1.jpg><p>The actors didn’t know each other before shooting <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Big Bang Theory</i></a>. But when they met, they felt an&nbsp;immediate connection. Cuoco admits that she had a&nbsp;big crush on&nbsp;Galecki early on&nbsp;and wasn’t even hiding&nbsp;it. When she found out he&nbsp;had eyes for her, too, she was like, “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Uh‑oh, this is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;trouble</i></a>.”</p><p><h2>Their on-screen kiss was their actual first kiss in&nbsp;real life too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/294/797/aaeb205916b52ad951e4f276fb.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the sixth episode of&nbsp;the series, Penny kisses Leonard at&nbsp;her Halloween party after her ex-boyfriend shows&nbsp;up. And technically speaking, it&nbsp;was their first kiss in&nbsp;real life too. It&nbsp;was apparent there was some chemistry between them. But it&nbsp;took them the whole first season until they finally got together.</p><p>Galecki even joked about&nbsp;it, asking Cuoco whether he&nbsp;kisses differently in&nbsp;character. She says she was very nervous about the on-screen and real-life first kisses. It&nbsp;felt weird to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kiss </a>a&nbsp;man she loved as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress before they even started <a href=# title=dating data-link=tag>dating</a>.</p><p><h2>When Cuoco broke up&nbsp;with her boyfriend, Galecki behaved like a&nbsp;real gentleman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a46/b5a/cfc3bc5046a4f7694afa6e9b2f.jpg><p>Cuoco was the youngest in&nbsp;the main cast. Maybe she didn’t hang out with them often because of&nbsp;that. But one day, Galecki left a&nbsp;voicemail inviting her to&nbsp;play board games with them and have fun. And she called him right back, saying she had just broken up&nbsp;with her boyfriend.</p><p>Nevertheless, she packed a&nbsp;bag, hopped in&nbsp;her car, and drove to&nbsp;Montecito, where the cast lived. It&nbsp;was pretty late. Her cabin was next to&nbsp;Galecki, and she wanted him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;around during this moment of&nbsp;her life. So&nbsp;she could think of&nbsp;nothing better than to&nbsp;call him and say there was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;bug in&nbsp;her room,</a> so&nbsp;he’d come to&nbsp;the rescue and kill&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2cb/438/83a8da54909f963be541bd094f.jpg><p>Galecki didn’t buy&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;felt a&nbsp;little bit premature. Though Cuoco still swears there was a&nbsp;bug in&nbsp;her room. And yes, she was flirting with him too! At&nbsp;that time, she thought it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent way to&nbsp;get him into her cabin to&nbsp;hang out with her.</p><p>Galecki was a&nbsp;real gentleman, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;did not go&nbsp;to&nbsp;her cabin. Though still, to&nbsp;this day, he&nbsp;doesn’t know if&nbsp;this story was just a&nbsp;trick or&nbsp;not or&nbsp;if&nbsp;she was flirting with him because she had just broken up&nbsp;with her boyfriend. Cuoco herself swears there was definitely a&nbsp;bug in&nbsp;her room... And yes, she was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>flirting </a>with him.</p><p><h2>Galecki made the first move long after her breakup.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/210/16b/a076285f4381f8720d52c4b21d.jpg><p>Galecki decided not to&nbsp;make the first move until the dust from Cuoco’s breakup settled. He&nbsp;texted her, inviting her to&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant. And she texted back, saying yes. She was there in&nbsp;like 20&nbsp;minutes, which Galecki found pretty cute. He&nbsp;was like, “Oh, okay, there’s some mutual sharing of&nbsp;feelings here.”</p><p>There they had their first kiss as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple. That kiss continued in&nbsp;the parking lot and then at&nbsp;Cuoco’s place. She disappeared for a&nbsp;moment, took a&nbsp;shower, came back, sat, and Galecki said, “Okay, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>I&nbsp;guess we’re dating</a>! We&nbsp;can’t tell anyone!” So&nbsp;they kept it&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret.</p><p><h2>They started dating even before Leonard and Penny began dating in&nbsp;the series.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4d/638/495c815fe3a2cc01f255541aab.jpg><p>Though their first kiss was on&nbsp;set, they started dating in&nbsp;real life before their characters. But they didn’t want to&nbsp;worry anyone, especially their fans, so&nbsp;they started to&nbsp;hide like kids hiding from their parents: both on&nbsp;set and in&nbsp;real life.</p><p>Galecki was very protective of&nbsp;what the fans would think. He&nbsp;wanted Leonard and Penny together so&nbsp;much that they felt it&nbsp;would ruin the fantasy if&nbsp;they saw them together in&nbsp;real life. He&nbsp;thought that would affect their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acceptance </a>of&nbsp;the characters. Cuoco was respectful and totally supported Galecki in&nbsp;his decision to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;all quiet.</p><p><h2>Jim Parsons was the first person they told.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0bb/98b/12b0dd5efab70e33a8478d9471.jpg><p>They didn’t tell anyone about their relationship for a&nbsp;long time. They don’t even remember how many months later they decided to&nbsp;tell the cast everything. They were in&nbsp;New York when Galecki said he&nbsp;would call Parsons and tell him first.</p><p>They called him on&nbsp;speaker, and Galecki said something like, “I’m in&nbsp;love with Kaley,” or&nbsp;“I&nbsp;really want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with Kaley.” Parsons’ reaction was the cutest thing they’d ever heard&nbsp;— he&nbsp;asked, “Ah! Does she know?!” Kayley started laughing and said, “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Yes, I&nbsp;know!</a>”</p><p><h2>They’ve split up&nbsp;but never stopped to&nbsp;support each other.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/518/99f/8f3779524b8dce0798fd87ef95.jpg><p>They dated for nearly 2&nbsp;years and even considered getting married at&nbsp;one point. But after all, they decided they were better off as&nbsp;friends. They adored each other, and there was nothing wrong with their relationship. It&nbsp;just ended.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;hurt, but they’ve supported each other ever since. They continue to&nbsp;love one another, says Galecki, in&nbsp;different ways. No&nbsp;matter what, they always had each other’s backs, and they didn’t want to&nbsp;lose that. Galecki was even front row at&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>both Cuoco’s weddings</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b18/a47/7d6055557f8a372bc48f679b5b.jpg><p>It&nbsp;took time to&nbsp;get through their breakup, but a&nbsp;work commitment helped speed up&nbsp;the healing process. They got very close through the show and all they’ve gone through. They always felt pretty comfortable with each other and finished each other’s sentences.</p><p>They knew their characters so&nbsp;well that Galecki became a&nbsp;steadfast person in&nbsp;her life, on&nbsp;that show, on&nbsp;that set. She was sure that even if&nbsp;things weren’t going well on&nbsp;set and someone didn’t like something, they were both always <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>99.99% on&nbsp;the same page</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/776/1a1/d170bf52c09d61ee81e4ccfbd2.jpg><p>That was quite an&nbsp;incredible journey for them both!
