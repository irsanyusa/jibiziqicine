But if you are wondering how to learn basic German, there’s no reason why you can’t do it fast because it’s really no more difficult than any other language.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to learn more about this, check out our article on<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> why German is easier than you think</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11 tips to learn German as a beginner</h2><li><a href=#>Set a goal</a></li><li><a href=#>Learn basic words in German</a></li><li><a href=#>Learn vocabulary in chunks</a></li><li><a href=#>Find fun ways to learn German</a></li><li><a href=#>Watch TV and videos in German</a></li><li><a href=#>Get out of your comfort zone</a></li><li><a href=#>Find a language exchange partner</a></li><li><a href=#>Join an online class</a></li><li><a href=#>Expose yourself to German any chance you get</a></li><li><a href=#>Do an intensive course</a></li><li><a href=#>Embrace your mistakes</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Set-a-goal>1. Set a goal</h2><p>If you’re going to learn German from scratch, you need to have a goal in mind to keep you motivated and give you a sense of achievement when you reach it. Make sure the goal is achievable – you’re not going to be reading Nietzsche’s philosophy after a month – and make it real world.&nbsp;</p><p>You might be tempted to set a goal like I will learn 100 words in a month. This is achievable, but it’s not the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>A much better goal is: I will order an entire meal in German by the end of the month. Or: In six weeks, I will make small talk with my colleagues only in German. If you’re not in Germany, you might set this goal: I will speak to my language partner for 15 minutes without using English.</p><p>Your longer-term goal will likely be to become fluent or at least semi-fluent in German. Wondering if this can happen in three months?<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> It’s possible</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Learn-basic-words-in-German>2. Learn basic words in German</h2><p>This tip might seem a bit obvious. But, it’s important to figure out what the basic words are in your context. Cat is a basic word. But if you’re learning German for work, you’re probably not going to be talking about cats that often.&nbsp;</p><p>Start with the verbs you use most often, like be, have, want and go. It’s also a great idea to learn the modal verbs like can, must and might. In German, the verbs change depending on who’s speaking but a lot more than they do in English since there is the category of case in German grammar.</p><p>Learning the rules of basic German grammar is essential, and the good news is that the German language is very logical, despite the presence of some exceptions, as in any language.</p><p>Look at word lists of the 500 most commonly used words in German and, if you’re learning business German, think about the words you use most often in your industry.</p><p>Want to learn the numbers? Check out<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> this blog post</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Learn-vocabulary-in-chunks>3. Learn vocabulary in chunks</h2><p>Step up your vocabulary learning by studying meaningful chunks of language instead of just single words. So when you learn the word train, Zug, learn how to say by train, mit dem Zug, so you can use the word in context.</p><p>If you’re learning verbs, you can go even further and memorise whole phrases that you’ll be able to alter as your vocabulary grows. With can, können, learn I can play the piano and eventually you’ll be able to replace play the piano with speak German.&nbsp;</p><p>Ich kann Deutsch sprechen!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Find-fun-ways-to-learn-German>4. Find fun ways to learn German</h2><p>Most of us don’t think of German as a fun language. But learning German for beginners can definitely be interesting if you make it so.</p><p>Listen to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> German music</a> or a podcast, or watch a great German TV show. If you’re into cooking, write your shopping list and cook a recipe in German.</p><p>Whatever you’re into, try doing it in German. Even if you’re a beginner, learning German can be fun.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Watch-TV-and-videos-in-German>5. Watch TV and videos in German</h2><p>Think you’re wasting your time on YouTube? Think again, as long as you switch to watching TV and videos in German. You’ll usually have subtitles available in English, so start with those and when you’re ready, graduate to just having German subtitles. This is great for pronunciation and a good way to learn spelling as well.&nbsp;</p><p>And don’t forget<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> TikTok</a> – 15-second videos might be just the right length for someone new to German. And, you can be sure you’ll know the latest German slang.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Get-out-of-your-comfort-zone>6. Get out of your comfort zone</h2><p>Doing anything new can be scary for adults. We’re not used to doing things we’re not good at. But the best way to learn German fast is to do things that make you nervous. And for most people, this is speaking.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re in Germany, it might be as simple as going to a cafe and ordering everything in German. So what if you end up with a small black coffee instead of a large latte? The first step isn’t about doing it right, it’s just about doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also start by joining an<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> online language forum</a> and practicing with real people for free.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-Find-a-language-exchange-partner>7. Find a language exchange partner</h2><p>Engaging with native speakers of the foreign language you are learning through language exchange partners can be a great way to practice your speaking skills.</p><p>By conversing with native speakers, you can practice speaking and listening, improve your understanding of basic spoken German, and learn new words and phrases.</p><p>Conversation partners whose native language is German provide opportunities to immerse yourself in the German language, improve your German skills, and gain confidence in communication.</p><p>Whether you’re a beginner or advanced learner, interacting with native speakers offers real-world practice that complements traditional language learning methods.</p><p>Through language exchange platforms, meetup or facebook groups, you can connect with native German speakers who are eager to help you learn. By engaging in conversations with them, you can learn German in a natural, interactive way. You’ll have the chance to practice speaking, receive feedback on your<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> pronunciation</a>, and expand your vocabulary.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tandem</a> is also a great resource for this –or look for native speakers in your area. However, you do it, speak, speak, speak.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8.-Join-an-online-class>8. Join an online class</h2><p>If you’re looking to learn basic German fast and in a way that fits into your busy schedule, think about joining an online class. You’ll have a teacher to correct your mistakes and a curriculum to follow to make sure you’re making progress and staying on track.</p><p>And, you can choose when and where to do your lessons, so no matter how busy you are, you can squeeze in a few hours of German classes every week.</p><p>This is also a safe space to practice your speaking because your teacher has a clause in their contract that says they’re not allowed to laugh at your mistakes. No, not really, but I promise they won’t anyway.<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Book a class</a> with Lingoda to check if I’m telling the truth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9.-Expose-yourself-to-German-any-chance-you-get>9. Expose yourself to German any chance you get</h2><p>If you’re aiming to learn German quickly, immerse yourself in the language at every opportunity. Switch your phone settings to German, listen to German radio stations and music, and incorporate German into your daily surroundings by labeling stuff in your house with the German word for each item.</p><p>Exposure to the language in various contexts helps reinforce vocabulary and pronunciation while enhancing your overall language skills. This constant exposure ensures that you’re consistently engaging with German, making progress more efficiently.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=10.-Do-an-intensive-German-course>10. Do an intensive German course</h2><p>Consider enrolling in an intensive German course, which can provide a structured and focused approach to learning. Institutions like the Goethe Institute offer great resources for learners seeking to start learning German or improve their language skills.

Embrace your mistakes</h2><p>Embracing your mistakes is an integral part of the language-learning journey, especially when it comes to mastering German. Recognize that errors are natural and inevitable steps toward improvement. Rather than fearing mistakes, view them as valuable learning opportunities.</p><p>Whether it’s mispronouncing words, making grammatical errors, or struggling with comprehension, each mistake provides valuable feedback for refining your German skills. By embracing your mistakes with a positive mindset, you’ll build resilience, develop a deeper understanding of the language, and ultimately progress more rapidly in your journey to fluency.</p><p>So, don’t be afraid to take risks, make errors, and learn from them – it’s all part of the process of becoming proficient in the German language.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Learn German fast with our 11 tips</strong></h2><p>Are you ready to learn German now?
