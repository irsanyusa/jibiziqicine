Today, I’m taking you on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip you aren’t going to&nbsp;forget anytime soon. But suit&nbsp;up! This is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;get very cold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7d7/ea1/6207e25a7f83057b4356aaa43c.png><p>You hop on&nbsp;a&nbsp;plane and land on&nbsp;the ice-covered island of&nbsp;Greenland. An&nbsp;unbelievable view of&nbsp;the Aurora Borealis, aka the northern lights, is&nbsp;greeting you. You can’t believe your eyes! Your guide tells you how rare this phenomenon&nbsp;is. Usually, people spend days trying to&nbsp;hunt it&nbsp;down.</p><p>You feel lucky and take your time to&nbsp;appreciate these beautiful dancing greenish lights. You’re glad you have brought that camera along, aren’t you? Between clicks, you learn that the Aurora Borealis is&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;some rather rough events. This spectacular light show occurs when high-energy particles from the Sun slam into Earth’s upper atmosphere.</p><p>On&nbsp;day two, you continue to&nbsp;explore the place by&nbsp;air. This may not come as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise, but Greenland is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the world’s largest islands. This time, on&nbsp;board a&nbsp;helicopter, you can see the infinite icy landscape. In&nbsp;case you’re curious, you are now flying over 656,000&nbsp;sq. miles of&nbsp;thick ice.</p><p>Oh! What is&nbsp;it&nbsp;down there? It&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;polar bears! You don’t want to&nbsp;get too close, of&nbsp;course. The conditions in&nbsp;Greenland may be&nbsp;too tough for people to&nbsp;live there, but some animal species do&nbsp;very well in&nbsp;this land of&nbsp;ice. Those are reindeer, wolves, and arctic foxes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6c9/66c/4d3dba5b069063fcd0358ed93b.png><p>On&nbsp;your way to&nbsp;Greenland, you probably made a&nbsp;pit stop in&nbsp;Copenhagen. Denmark is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the few countries that have commercial flights to&nbsp;Greenland. You didn’t know this before, but you find out that the island is&nbsp;actually part of&nbsp;the Kingdom of&nbsp;Denmark. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;map, it’s right between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. You’re lucky you have a&nbsp;local pilot that tells you about the secrets hidden in&nbsp;this scenery.</p><p>Under this 2-mile-thick white surface, there’s an&nbsp;entirely different world. A&nbsp;world filled with canyons, meteor-carved craters, and millennia-old plant fossils. You are beyond excited to&nbsp;go&nbsp;visit each of&nbsp;these spots. But of&nbsp;course, you’ll have to&nbsp;use your imagination, as&nbsp;all of&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;hidden under the ice. Believe it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, nearly&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;the island’s surface is&nbsp;covered with&nbsp;it.</p><p>The first stop on&nbsp;your tour is&nbsp;Greenland’s Grand Canyon. You land not far from&nbsp;it, somewhere in&nbsp;the northern part of&nbsp;the island. You may know that canyons are deep, narrow valleys with steep sides. But I&nbsp;bet you didn’t know that the word canyon actually comes from the Spanish word cañon, which means “tube” or&nbsp;“pipe.” Now, this Grand Canyon has some similarities with the one in&nbsp;the US.</p><p>First of&nbsp;all, in&nbsp;size. It’s at&nbsp;least 460 miles long and up&nbsp;to&nbsp;2,600 feet deep in&nbsp;some places. There’s a&nbsp;true subglacial valley down there. And if&nbsp;you’re wondering how this happened.... Well, the canyon had probably been formed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=river data-link=tag>river</a> that had been flowing through Greenland before the ice took over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7cc/c37/832c1c55049f549028da7c36ce.png><p>Oh, yes. Greenland hasn’t always been covered with ice. It&nbsp;was once green&nbsp;— no&nbsp;pun intended! Many other icy places on&nbsp;Earth, such as&nbsp;<a href=# title=Antarctica data-link=tag>Antarctica</a>, were once covered in&nbsp;greenery. Scientists have figured out that in&nbsp;the past, Greenland was mostly ice-free. With the help of&nbsp;airborne radar, they made amazing discoveries. (By&nbsp;the way, ice is&nbsp;invisible to&nbsp;radar technology!</p><p>If&nbsp;you have trouble believing&nbsp;it, try putting an&nbsp;ice cube inside your microwave. It&nbsp;won’t melt or&nbsp;heat&nbsp;up!) A&nbsp;recent discovery of&nbsp;fossilized plants allowed researchers to&nbsp;estimate that Greenland used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;much warmer than they could imagine! 2021 research conducted by&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Vermont found fossils of&nbsp;twigs and leaves, which left researchers very confused. They expected to&nbsp;discover sand and rocks in&nbsp;the deepest layer of&nbsp;ice. But instead, they found some clear proof of&nbsp;rich flora!</p><p>Judging by&nbsp;what you’ve seen of&nbsp;the landscape, it’s hard to&nbsp;believe that forests were once growing here. Today, you’ll find some tundra vegetation on&nbsp;the coastal part of&nbsp;the island. And that’s pretty much&nbsp;it. But according to&nbsp;the genetic material found in&nbsp;these fossilized plants, researchers believe the island used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;much greener. It’s very likely that there were insect-filled forests with butterflies and beetles flying around. And the average temperature on&nbsp;the island varied from 50˚F in&nbsp;the summer to&nbsp;1˚F in&nbsp;the winter. <a href=# title=NASA data-link=tag>NASA</a>’s Operation IceBridge has flown over Greenland more than 100&nbsp;times.</p><p>This has allowed researchers to&nbsp;create 3D&nbsp;maps of&nbsp;the island and figure out the age of&nbsp;each layer of&nbsp;ice in&nbsp;Greenland’s Ice Sheet. Ice sheets can help answer many scientific questions as&nbsp;they form over the span of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;years. They’re layers of&nbsp;snow on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;more snow. The snow gets compacted into ice, which, in&nbsp;turn, creates what we&nbsp;call an&nbsp;ice sheet. Remember those fossils we&nbsp;were talking about? They are believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;from the Eemian period, which was 130,000 to&nbsp;115,000 years ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/48b/676/b6b9825dbeb528a56c37fc3dc5.png><p>According to&nbsp;the groundbreaking 3D&nbsp;footage from NASA, we&nbsp;can see three distinct climate periods within the ice sheet. The uppermost layer is&nbsp;quite flat and uniform. If&nbsp;you decided to&nbsp;dig deeper, you’d find the layer formed during the last Ice Age. It’s more complex and rugged. The ice there is&nbsp;darker than what you see on&nbsp;the surface.</p><p>If&nbsp;you let your mind wander, you can picture what this part of&nbsp;the world looked like when mammoths were roaming around. If&nbsp;you kept digging, you’d eventually find leftover ice from the Eemian period I’ve told you about. Now, canyons aren’t the only unusual thing found under the ice! If&nbsp;you could sneak a&nbsp;peek under all those layers of&nbsp;snow, you’d see an&nbsp;impressive mountain range and also plunging fjords!</p><p>In&nbsp;2017, scientists created a&nbsp;map that showed what Greenland had looked like without all that ice. There was a&nbsp;bowl-like depression in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the enormous island. This depression was most likely an&nbsp;ancient lake. Around&nbsp;it, there was a&nbsp;circle of&nbsp;coastal mountain ranges. This scenery probably resembled the landscapes of&nbsp;modern Patagonia. Big mountains with snowy tops, surrounding crystalline lakes.</p><p>This ancient lake in&nbsp;Greenland is&nbsp;a&nbsp;wonder on&nbsp;its own. Imagine a&nbsp;pit the size of&nbsp;Rhode Island and Delaware put together! The lake is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;have covered over 2,700 square miles, and back in&nbsp;the day, it&nbsp;was fed by&nbsp;at&nbsp;least 18&nbsp;different streams. These crystalline blue waters were surely very inviting! And freezing, of&nbsp;course. But if&nbsp;you ended up&nbsp;going for a&nbsp;swim, I’d say be&nbsp;careful! As&nbsp;the water could get up&nbsp;to&nbsp;800 feet deep in&nbsp;some places.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4f0/f59/591d1658a6bc53f7d2600304d4.png><p>On&nbsp;day three of&nbsp;your adventure, you discover a&nbsp;true under-ice water park! While you’re wandering around the ice-covered island, your guide tells you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mindful of&nbsp;the cracks in&nbsp;the surface. These cracks are responsible for the modern-day “aqua lounge” going on&nbsp;down there. Meltwater and rainwater flow down the cracks in&nbsp;the ice all the way down to&nbsp;the riverbeds. This forms a&nbsp;landscape of&nbsp;jewel-like lakes and streams filled with crystalline water.</p><p>Researchers estimate that about 60&nbsp;small under-ice lakes exist there. And yes, they’re actual lakes! Perhaps one of&nbsp;the most impressive hidden features on&nbsp;this island is&nbsp;a&nbsp;meteor crater! Under the Hiawatha glacier, you can find a&nbsp;19-mile-wide impact crater, big enough to&nbsp;swallow the city of&nbsp;Washington! Apparently, a&nbsp;mile-wide iron asteroid struck Earth’s atmosphere within the past 100,000 years and chose Greenland as&nbsp;its landing point. If&nbsp;anyone had been around to&nbsp;see&nbsp;it, they’d have witnessed a&nbsp;real show&nbsp;— a&nbsp;white glowing fireball cutting through the sky!</p><p>Scientists speculate that if&nbsp;it&nbsp;landed on&nbsp;an&nbsp;ice sheet, it&nbsp;certainly vaporized both water and stone. Someone standing hundreds of&nbsp;miles from the impact site would have heard a&nbsp;deafening thunderclap and experienced hurricane-force winds. But it&nbsp;actually makes sense. The approximate speed of&nbsp;meteors entering Earth’s atmosphere is&nbsp;45,000&nbsp;mph. For comparison, that is&nbsp;two and half times the speed of&nbsp;a&nbsp;spaceship! It’s bound to&nbsp;make some noise and leave a&nbsp;huge crater in&nbsp;the ground!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCktcSnq6KrpKh6p7vUp5tmq6Snrq%2BzxGamm6KVmMG0edSnm56qXZy%2FprHNpZinnF2esKZ5l2pscGphZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
