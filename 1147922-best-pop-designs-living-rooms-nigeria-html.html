This material is being widely used all over Europe for decades for various types of works. For example, during the time of Renaissance, artists and architects thought that plaster of Paris is the best material for decorating ceilings and walls in the palaces and cathedrals, and they were right – most of the buildings made with this material are still standing and blossoming. Plaster of Paris is called so because the abundant gypsum used for its preparation is being found not far from Paris. Some of its benefits include hardening when it is moistened, and not cracking or shrinking when it is dry.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2faa57fa890010a3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 50 cool bear tattoo design ideas and meanings for your inspiration</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2faa57fa890010a3.jpg><p class=align-left>Nowadays, POP still remains relevant, and it adds a lot of sophistication to every house.

Futuristic design</h2><p class=align-left>In the early 20th century, the futuristic movement has become really popular among all the creative people – writers, artists, movie creators. Of course, it did not bypass the architects, who were especially inspired by futuristic ideas in the determined attempts to create unique and nice house designs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/660ba4bd7933b05e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 gorgeous easy henna designs for everyone!</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1asl8971r3s.jpg><p class=align-left>Usually, the futuristic interiors have strict geometric shapes or free lines that symbolize the freedom of modern outlook on the interior styling. Sometimes neon lights can be used, to make it seem like you really traveled to the far future, not even exiting the house. Cool, isn’t it? If you are a fan of futuristic designs and are keen on space themes and science fiction, this living room style will be definitely appealing to you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/660ba4bd7933b05e.jpg><h2>2. Floral design</h2><p class=align-left>If you are a romantic person and love flowery themes, you surely would not want to miss this option. The trick with floral designs is that they always make you feel like you are in open space, and almost create an impression that you are outside, in a secluded field, enjoying the music of nature and smell of flowers. This usually helps people concentrate on their work and creates a relaxing atmosphere.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7b1ftqadfah.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beads are trendy!

Creative wall and ceiling design</h2><p class=align-left>These designs are the hardest to replicate, but they are really worth it in the end and look really creative and fabulous. The main idea of it is to create a continuous design, which will start on the floor and then proceed to spread on the walls and ceiling. By the way, the ornament does not have to be refined. Even if you decide to choose simplistic lines, your living room can get a whole new touch.</p><p class=align-left>Incorporated wall, ceiling, and floor designs will amaze all of your guests. They are modern, creative, and look gorgeous. Besides, they add a special atmosphere, making your room lively and stylish.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Pop ceiling designs in Nigeria</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7b1ftqadfah.jpg><h2>4. Minimalistic design</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8c4975f257fda45e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>60+ best Nigerian Ankara styles catalogue for ladies 2022</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Not everything needs to be pretentious nowadays. Some people prefer minimalism to luxury, and they are definitely not wrong. While the massive thematic designs that can cover the whole room can look epic, the minimalistic approach could make your living room really cozy, and it will look like there are no excessive things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7m12tcr3edj.jpg><p class=align-left>Minimalism includes simplistic geometric shapes and symbols that are easy to recognize. The walls usually will be one-toned and look simple, but you can decorate them with lovely paintings and other personal touches. Your mind and heart will rest in this room, and you will really feel at home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1en1nhb8qe4o.jpg><h2>5. Light-incorporating design</h2><p class=align-left>Of course, every room should have a source of light. In our common understanding, it is usually a regular chandelier. But what if you choose a creative way to incorporate light into your room? Quite often, the modern rooms involve sources of light in extremely different shapes and designs. Some of them even can change the colour of the lighting, which is a really interesting touch if you want to create a unique colour combination for a living room.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6rul69rt9a1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gorgeous church decorations for your wedding</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt48cjp2pj1rq.jpg><p class=align-left>Overall, these lighting designs can really blow your mind sometimes.
