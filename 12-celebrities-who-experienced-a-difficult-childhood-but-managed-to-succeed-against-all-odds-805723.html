However, in&nbsp;many cases, that is&nbsp;far from true. There are quite a&nbsp;few superstars out there whose childhoods resemble the scenes of&nbsp;horror movies. Luckily, all of&nbsp;them were strong and fortunate enough to&nbsp;overcome the challenges they were exposed to&nbsp;at&nbsp;such a&nbsp;young age.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> are always inspired by&nbsp;people who push forward no&nbsp;matter the circumstances and whose determination can make anyone feel more optimistic.</p><p><h2>1. Hilary Swank</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/299/194/03f6135222a184e288252b1f81.jpg><p>When <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talking</a> about her childhood, the Oscar-winning actress said that she grew up&nbsp;<a href=# title=poor data-link=tag>poor</a>, and because of&nbsp;that, the parents of&nbsp;her peers wouldn’t let their children play with her. Hilary’s older <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brother</a> left the family home early in&nbsp;his teens, and the actress’s parents separated when she was 16. Her mother was supportive of&nbsp;her acting career, so&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them moved to&nbsp;California, but <strong>couldn’t afford an&nbsp;apartment.</strong></p><p>Hilary ended up&nbsp;living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;trailer park while she attended acting lessons. Remembering her high <a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a> years, Hilary <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>: "<strong>I&nbsp;felt like such an&nbsp;outsider</strong>. I&nbsp;didn’t feel like&nbsp;I fit&nbsp;in. I&nbsp;didn’t belong in&nbsp;any way. I&nbsp;didn’t even feel like the teachers wanted me&nbsp;there. I&nbsp;just felt like&nbsp;I wasn’t seen or&nbsp;understood.’’</p><p><h2>2. Ashley Judd</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c68/eab/9084835732b314d7afa952a6cf.jpg><p>The gorgeous actress described the hardships she went through as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>book</a> <i>All That Is&nbsp;Bitter and Sweet</i>.

When her mother would go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tour, Ashely <strong>was left alone for long periods</strong>. The actress’s childhood traumas led her to&nbsp;develop <a href=# title=depression data-link=tag>depression</a> later in&nbsp;life. However, Judd has been able to&nbsp;overcome challenges by&nbsp;undergoing therapy.</p><p><h2>3.

Living in&nbsp;an&nbsp;extremely dangerous and poor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>neighborhood</a>, she was forced to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;much earlier than her peers.</p><p><a href=# title=Oprah data-link=tag>Oprah</a> gave birth to&nbsp;a&nbsp;son when she was just 14&nbsp;years old, but the <strong>baby died</strong> soon afterward. She was forced to&nbsp;look for a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>job</a> while she was still in&nbsp;high school, which led her to&nbsp;the position of&nbsp;a&nbsp;radio show host and from there, her career took off.</p><p><h2>4.
