After an exhilarating first night of semifinals, the show has officially announced which two acts will make it into the finale.</strong></p><p>On Tuesday night, Canada’s Got Talent premiered their first live semifinal of the season. Within the episode, fans of the series saw contestants: Trish’s Golden Buzzer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Conversion </a>(dance crew), Turnbull Brothers (singers), Paola Troilo (opera singer), Beatrice Love (singer), Alexandra Côté (dog trainor), Atsushi Ono (magician), Cool Giraffes (dance group), Mr. Cuddles (ventriloquist), and Golden Buzzer recipient, singer <a href=#>Maya Gamzu</a>.</p><p>If you missed it, after each contestant performed again, judges were able to automatically send through two acts. At the end of the episode, it was announced that Atsushi Ono and Conversion dance group would be continuing into the finale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-which-contestants-are-continuing-into-the-finale>Which Contestants Are Continuing Into The Finale?</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Atsushi Ono</h3><p>Outstanding magician Atsushi Ono was one of the acts continuing into the finale, by judge choice. The 44 year old magician continues to dazzle the judges each time he comes to the CGT stage. In his semifinal performance, he played off his tricks as if it was all a memory trick. He made Howie Mandel and Trish Stratus’ card appear out of thin air multiple times.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Conversion</h3><p>Trish Stratus’s Golden Buzzer group, Conversion, was the other act that judges picked to continue into the finale. In this performance, the dance group managed to move the audience, just like in their audition. Their movements were once again completely synchronized and outstanding.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Turnbull Brothers</h3><p>19 year old twins Evan and Aaron Turnbull, aka the Turnbull Brothers, were the first Canada-voted contestants to secure their place in the finale. The Novia Soca natives returned to the CGT singing “Heaven” by Los Lonely Boys. While live on Breakfast Television, Trish Stratus and Kardinal Offishall admitted that two Tim Horton’s workers weren’t their pick to win the season, but if that’s what Canada wants, they understand.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cool Giraffes</h3><p>The second Canada-voted in finalist is dance crew Cool Giraffes. The unique group impressed in their audition, but judges admitted that this performance missed the final build up moment. While live on Breakfast Television, Trish Stratus said that she wished the group would amp up their next dance to include a climax of some sort.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>These four contestants are the first announced for the upcoming Canada’s Got Talent finale. The 2-hour long live finale airs on Tuesday, May 16 on Citytv. For those who may not know, this season’s CGT winner will be awarded $150,000.</p><p>Canada’s Got Talent returns to Citytv this Tuesday with their second installment of the Semifinals. This time around fans will see remaining acts: The Cast (dance group), Raymond Salgado (singer), GBA (circus act), Katherine Lynn-Rose (singer), Meave (singer), Magic Ben (magician), Curran Dobbs (comedian), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anica</a> (singer), and Geneviève Côté (novelty act).</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_DerekHough_MarkBallas_Jesse-GrantGetty-Images-for-Mixology101LA-220x147.jpeg alt="Derek Hough Reveals His Best Man For Upcoming Wedding" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqlmpyRqHqou9Nmq5qklaPBbq3Np6auppOawG6%2FxKagn6GelrlufYyrnKytnKnAbsPHqKpmn5%2Beu6h5yKerqGWknbJussinmKWdXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
