But not this strong-willed 99-year-old man. He&nbsp;insisted on&nbsp;divorcing his wife of&nbsp;77&nbsp;years after uncovering a&nbsp;decades-old affair. Let’s learn more about their story.</p><p><h2>While this may sound romantic, it&nbsp;certainly wasn’t for the husband.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2a9/065/9938965f2cb33ca8234d1377ea.png><p>In&nbsp;2011, an&nbsp;<a href=# title=Italian data-link=tag>Italian</a> man, Antonio&nbsp;C., aged&nbsp;99, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> headlines with a&nbsp;surprising discovery about his wife, Rosa C. Just before Christmas, Antonio found out that Rosa had been keeping love letters from an&nbsp;old flame from the 1940s a&nbsp;secret.</p><p>When he&nbsp;confronted her, Rosa confessed to&nbsp;having had an&nbsp;affair over 60&nbsp;years ago. This revelation was a&nbsp;turning point for Antonio, who decided to&nbsp;end their 77-year-long <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> by&nbsp;demanding a&nbsp;divorce. The couple had five children, a&nbsp;dozen grandchildren, and even a&nbsp;great-grandchild, as&nbsp;per local reports.</p><p><h2>The letters were written by&nbsp;Rosa to&nbsp;her lover during a&nbsp;secret relationship in&nbsp;the 1940s, according to&nbsp;court documents released in&nbsp;Rome.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bc5/6bc/e898d4501ea4dd12f629b210c4.png><p>Rosa tried to&nbsp;convince Antonio that they should stay together, since they had been together for most of&nbsp;their lives. But Antonio wasn’t convinced and went ahead to&nbsp;file for divorce. The love letters were found in&nbsp;an&nbsp;old chest of&nbsp;drawers, and this discovery seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the final straw in&nbsp;their rocky <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>, which had been shaky for years.</p><p>This story has been circulating on&nbsp;social media, sparking discussions among users. Many expressed sympathy for the elderly man, understanding that he&nbsp;must have been deeply hurt, despite the affair happening so&nbsp;long ago. The Italian media attributed the bitter breakup to&nbsp;the couple’s southern backgrounds&nbsp;— Antonio is&nbsp;originally from Olbia in&nbsp;Sardinia, while Rosa was born in&nbsp;Naples.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ee9/00c/0f8c0d5a1794f6c0d3c2ee604e.png><p>Antonio and Rosa first met back in&nbsp;the 1930s when Antonio was a&nbsp;young officer stationed in&nbsp;Naples. They fell in&nbsp;love and got married, starting a&nbsp;long journey together that lasted almost eighty years. Despite some tough times, like a&nbsp;short break they took, they stayed together until Antonio found out about Rosa’s old love letters.</p><p><h2>Antonio and Rosa unintentionally become the oldest couple to&nbsp;divorce.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d1e/d67/eca234575780131cae2f0b9472.png><p>Their story has similarities to&nbsp;another elderly couple, Bertie and Jessie Wood. They were from the&nbsp;<a href=# title=UK data-link=tag>UK</a> and made headlines when they decided to&nbsp;get divorced at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;98, just a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years before turning 100.</p><p>Bertie and Jessie Wood, both aged&nbsp;98, gained attention when they decided to&nbsp;end their 36-year-long marriage, marking them as&nbsp;the oldest divorcees <strong>at&nbsp;the time</strong>. Their decision was notable not only due to&nbsp;their age but also because of&nbsp;the longevity of&nbsp;their union. Having <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tied the knot</a> in&nbsp;1972 in&nbsp;Elstree, Hertfordshire, the couple had spent decades together before their relationship reached its conclusion.</p><p><h2>Well, they definitely showed that age is&nbsp;no&nbsp;barrier.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9eb/ef1/af051a554ea50eb85fc39fdf15.png><p>Despite their advanced age, the decision to&nbsp;part ways highlighted that the complexities of&nbsp;human relationships are not bound by&nbsp;age. Their story served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder that life’s journey continues to&nbsp;unfold and evolve even in&nbsp;the twilight years. While their divorce may have been unexpected to&nbsp;some, it&nbsp;underscored the individuality and autonomy that persists regardless of&nbsp;age. This inspires reflection on&nbsp;the nature of&nbsp;love, commitment, and personal fulfillment in&nbsp;later life stages.</p><p>Deciding to&nbsp;end a&nbsp;relationship later in&nbsp;life can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;courageous choice, giving people a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;their own <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a> and well-being. It’s a&nbsp;chance for new beginnings, self-discovery, and growth. Leaving behind what doesn’t make them happy can bring a&nbsp;fresh sense of&nbsp;energy and purpose, reminding them that it’s never too late to&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>find joy and fulfillment in&nbsp;life</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZ6ediemKtln6GxbrnAp2SeppSoeq6t0augmp%2BVYq6nwMSrZJ2ho5i8t7HRoqWgZaees6a%2FjGpwbWijYq6nssCiqWarpKS%2FunnOn2StoJVisaavwJ2cZnBhboBxhI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
