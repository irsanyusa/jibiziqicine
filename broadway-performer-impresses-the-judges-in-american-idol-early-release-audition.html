The judges were wowed by her powerful voice, calling her performance their favorite audition thus far.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nya-auditions-for-american-idol-in-early-release>Nya Auditions for American Idol in Early Release</h2><p>Nya introduced herself to the judges as a Broadway performer. She revealed that she was recently in the cast of Caroline, or Change, and she also appeared in the off-Broadway musical Titanique. She shared that she’s Kenyan and grew up in Florida.</p><p>For her audition, Nya performed “Wait a Minute!” by Willow. The judges, especially Lionel Richie, were clearly blown away by her talent as she sang. All three of them gave her a standing ovation when she was done singing.</p><p>“Maybe my favorite performance or audition this year, thus far,” Luke Bryan told Nya. “The most impressive thing is you don’t sound Broadway … You are actually a massive singer, a massive personality.”</p><p>Richie told Nya that she has “effortless control,” and her “personality is already defined.” He added that she has what it takes to “go all the way,” as he agreed with Bryan that it was the best audition so far this season.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AMERICAN IDOL’ HEADS TO JUDGES’ HOMETOWNS IN SEASON 22 PREMIERE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katy-perry-gave-the-singer-a-fan>Katy Perry Gave the Singer a Fan</h2><p>Judge Katy Perry told Nya that all she needs is a fan at her feet to give her hair a windswept effect. A crew member ended up handing her an electric fan, which Perry held for Nya, joking, “I’ll be your biggest fan.”</p><p>Perry actually knelt at Nya’s feet holding the fan under her so her hair would move as she performed a few more lines from “Wait a Minute!” Afterward, Nya laughed and said she was having “so much fun” with the judges.</p><p>“There is no de-Nya-ing that you are a star,” Perry told the singer before voting “yes” to sending her to Hollywood. Her fellow judges agreed, as they handed Nya a Golden Ticket.</p><p>Catch a new episode of American Idol Season 22 this Sunday night on ABC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BGTJudges_Hosts_Jeff-Spicer_WireImage-220x147.jpg alt="Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden’s Kids Hit Golden Buzzer on ‘Britain’s Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waummpynlsZuvMSrnaiqnZq%2FbrXMqameq6OawG7Ax55ko62UnLK0ecinZJqllae2pK3NZqCdp5xisqK%2By7Jkq52cmq60sYyarJ2hpJ68r3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
