His wife Priscilla, a&nbsp;beauty with an&nbsp;angelic face, was 10&nbsp;years younger than him. She became the only woman who ever received a&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> proposal from Elvis. And he&nbsp;was the man who she called the love of&nbsp;her life even after time, separations, quarrels, and <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;dig deeper into Priscilla’s story and why she felt she couldn’t show herself to&nbsp;her husband without makeup.</p><p><strong>He&nbsp;was&nbsp;24, she was 14</strong>. They <a href=#>met</a> in&nbsp;1959&nbsp;at a&nbsp;party hosted by&nbsp;Elvis, who was serving in&nbsp;the army in&nbsp;those days. The pretty girl immediately caught his attention. To&nbsp;impress her, he&nbsp;played a&nbsp;few songs, including, “Are You Lonesome Tonight?”. When Priscilla left the party, she was sure she would never see Presley again. But fate had other plans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cdf/8bb/5689e0508292e80228a884516f.jpg><p>Elvis noticed that Priscilla looked like his recently departed mother, Gladys, whom he&nbsp;missed very much. Soon afterward the musician invited her on&nbsp;a&nbsp;date, where they kissed for the first time. Priscilla’s parents were really worried and said they wanted to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;Presley in&nbsp;person. When they met, Elvis impressed them so&nbsp;much that they immediately forgot about their worries. He&nbsp;told them that he&nbsp;had sincere feelings for their daughter and he&nbsp;felt that, mentally, their daughter was much older than her age.</p><p>When the relationship between them was just beginning, Elvis <a href=#>told</a> his friend Rex Mansfield that Priscilla was “<strong>young enough that&nbsp;I can train her any way I&nbsp;want.</strong>” Meanwhile, the young lady fell so&nbsp;desperately <a href=#>in&nbsp;love</a> with her “king” that he&nbsp;became the center of&nbsp;her world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d4a/041/f8f3565ce0ab8cc0f8ed188444.jpg><p>Gradually they began to&nbsp;date. Priscilla put on&nbsp;makeup and <strong>borrowed her mother’s clothes</strong>, hoping that Elvis’s friends would think she was at&nbsp;least 16. There were always a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people at&nbsp;parties in&nbsp;his mansion, everyone was talking, laughing, and waiting for Elvis to&nbsp;come down from his room. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;he&nbsp;appeared, it&nbsp;would become quiet in&nbsp;the living room: everyone would try to&nbsp;guess how his mood would&nbsp;be. “No&nbsp;one, including myself, dared joke around unless he&nbsp;laughed and then we&nbsp;all laughed,” <a href=#>said </a>Priscilla about those times.</p><p>“Nights when his mood was calm and peaceful, he&nbsp;would describe his ideal woman and tell me&nbsp;how perfectly&nbsp;I fit this image. He&nbsp;<a href=#>liked</a> soft-spoken brunettes with blue eyes. <strong>He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;mold me&nbsp;to&nbsp;his opinions and preferences. </strong>Fidelity was very important to&nbsp;him, especially on&nbsp;the woman’s part,” said Priscilla.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df0/0a0/4940f25d0290999aa3f53da427.jpg><p>Due to&nbsp;their <a href=#>age difference</a>, and because Elvis appreciated Priscilla’s youth and purity, he&nbsp;was ready to&nbsp;wait until she became an&nbsp;adult. However, over the course of&nbsp;their relationship, Presley had other women, from neighboring girls to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> stars.</p><p>Priscilla and Elvis looked like each other for a&nbsp;reason. <strong>Presley “sculpted” her in&nbsp;his own image and likeness</strong>. Besides, he&nbsp;asked his hairdresser to&nbsp;dye his girlfriend’s hair black, like his own, and to&nbsp;style their locks in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar way. That is&nbsp;why, later, Priscilla described herself as&nbsp;“Elvis’ living doll.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b3/066/c1f0925ce8b1c66c2f437a91ac.jpg><p>She couldn’t show herself to&nbsp;him without having her makeup and hair done because he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;see the process of&nbsp;creating beauty, he&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;see the <a href=#>final result</a>. Priscilla did everything to&nbsp;make Elvis happy. It&nbsp;didn’t matter what she wanted or&nbsp;whether she had any issues of&nbsp;her own.</p><p>The couple got married and Priscilla became pregnant right afterward. This made Elvis worry about how parenting would affect his career. <strong>When Priscilla was 7&nbsp;months pregnant, he&nbsp;asked to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break in&nbsp;their relationship.</strong> Soon, when their daughter Lisa Marie was born, the lovers got back together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c0/3e6/3788e158f7ae8ab452adf56e1c.jpg><p>After giving birth, Priscilla found out that Elvis continued to&nbsp;have affairs, like he&nbsp;did before their marriage. But Priscilla no&nbsp;longer wanted to&nbsp;just <a href=#>wait for him</a> like a&nbsp;faithful dog.</p><p>They were <a href=#>married</a> for a&nbsp;little over 6&nbsp;years. Later she confessed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that she divorced him not because she didn’t love him. “I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;find out about the world,” admitted Priscilla. “I&nbsp;didn’t have my&nbsp;teenage years as&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal girl, obviously, so&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;adapt. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;just kind of&nbsp;followed what he&nbsp;did. I&nbsp;mean, you lived his life. You honestly didn’t have your own life... So&nbsp;you really kind of&nbsp;lost yourself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f5c/5c9/32da1e52bb983da837befa7655.jpg><p>After the divorce, the former spouses shared custody of&nbsp;their daughter and saw each other regularly. When Priscilla found out about Elvis’ death, she was <a href=#>devastated</a>, and it&nbsp;took her a&nbsp;long time to&nbsp;get herself together and move&nbsp;on.</p><p>Their daughter <a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley</a> later became a&nbsp;singer, and she was married to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Michael Jackson" data-link=tag>Michael Jackson</a> and <a href=# title="Nicolas Cage" data-link=tag>Nicolas Cage</a>. One of&nbsp;the Presleys’ granddaughters, <a href=#>Riley Keough</a>, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;model and an&nbsp;actress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/407/d61/851ff05849b749ca85ae791f95.jpg><p>Priscilla kept her husband’s family name, but changed her hair and makeup style. After the divorce, she <a href=#>opened</a> a&nbsp;clothing boutique. Later she starred in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few movies. Her most famous roles are Jenna Wade on&nbsp;the Dallas TV&nbsp;series and Jane Spencer in&nbsp;The Naked Gun movies.</p><p>Priscilla began to&nbsp;form her own personality and <a href=#>realized </a>that a&nbsp;woman can have her own life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d13/433/bd9e1d5dcc817af0b91f2c1338.jpg><p>Priscilla is&nbsp;<a href=#>75&nbsp;years</a> old now. Since 2003, Presley has been the Ambassador of&nbsp;the Dream Foundation, a&nbsp;Santa Barbara-based wish-granting organization for terminally ill adults and their families.</p><p>Despite the fact that her marriage with Elvis wasn’t successful, Priscilla only has warm <a href=#>memories</a> of&nbsp;him. She still says that he&nbsp;was “the love of&nbsp;her life” and despite the difficulties they faced, she will love him forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ab/93b/76fe415d0e94d58ddfd2309ba4.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you think that life with a&nbsp;celebrity is&nbsp;always a&nbsp;trial for their significant other?
