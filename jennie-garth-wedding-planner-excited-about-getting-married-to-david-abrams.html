"He took me on a trip to the Carolinas and we went to this great dinner in this very crowded restaurant packed with people and then all of a sudden for no reason, there was no one in it," Garth recalled of the proposal. "Not a waiter or anyone. It was like the world sort of stopped spinning for a minute and it was so quiet. He got down on his knee and did thing."</p><p>The sweet gesture blew Garth away, but it was a moment that may have never happened! "I wasn't looking at all, in fact I didn't even want to go on the date with him and he didn't even want to go on a date with me," she continued. "We went out on a blind double date with another friend of his and we did not hit it off right away. He was like tall and handsome and perfect, and that's exactly what I didn't want."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>As for her stunning black diamond engagement ring? "He did a beautiful job and I was blown away," she previously told&nbsp;<a href=# id=ff6830e1-770e-5cd5-b170-7c562a6fee07>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;at Motrin's "Make It Happen" campaign event on May 4. "I love it so much. It’s very specific to my personality."</p><p>Garth is excited to marry her hunky beau, and revealed that "it's coming soon." In fact, she's handling most of the details herself. "I’m doing it myself. Just like I did my house design by myself. I like to call the shots and when I know what I want, the best person to make it happen usually is me,"</p><p>Garth is checking items off her to-do list left and right — including who will be in her bridal party. Daughters&nbsp;<strong>Luca</strong>, 17,&nbsp;<strong>Lola</strong>, 12, and<strong>&nbsp;Fiona</strong>, 8, whom she shares with ex-husband&nbsp;<strong>Peter Facinelli</strong>, will be standing next to her at the altar on the big day.</p><p>"They are definitely a part of everything," she gushed to Bush and Hoover. "They are going be my wedding party. It's going to be special and sweet."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7yZ6lp6GVYrSivtOhZLCdlJm2r7OMqaOapp6av26x15ygrZ2UYq6ju9StZKCdpKm2r7OMppirqpmasW7Azmabmq6ZmXqirtGapKxnZpy4u8LLrQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
