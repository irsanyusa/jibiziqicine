In that spirit, I called Australia’s Ambassador to the United States this morning to express my unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.”</p><p>Trump became furious with Turnbull during a phone call on Saturday when the prime minister&nbsp;asked him&nbsp;to honor a deal reached with&nbsp;the Obama administration to accept 1,250 refugees from Australian detention facilities, according to an article published by <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>. Turnbull’s request came a day after Trump had signed an executive order temporarily banning all refugees from entering the United States as a counterterrorism measure.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump <a href=#>criticized</a>&nbsp;the previous administration’s agreement with Australia&nbsp;and said the U.S. wouldn’t commit to honoring it. Trump also addressed the issue during his speech Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast.</p><p>“When you hear about the tough phone calls I’m having, don’t worry about it. Just don’t worry about it. They’re tough. We have to be tough,” he said. “It’s time we’re gonna be a little tough, folks. We’re taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually. It’s not gonna happen anymore.”</p><p>House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday downplayed the friction with Australia. Speaking with reporters at his weekly press conference, the Wisconsin Republican said he didn’t “think Australia should be worried about its relationship” with Trump or the United States.</p><p>“I think it is important presidents and prime ministers have candid and private conversations with one another,” he added.</p><p>Eli Yokley contributed to this story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhbHxxfo5paWilk5iuqrqMnJilpKNirra%2F06uYpaGRo3qiucGaqqyZlKS%2Fbq3MoptmrKKqurF5056lrKGfo8BuwNSrpZutnKF8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
