The 18-year-old singer wowed the judges in her audition and has remained a frontrunner in the competition thanks to her powerhouse voice.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicolina-grew-up-doing-musical-theater>Nicolina Grew Up Doing Musical Theater</h2><p>For her audition, Nicolina performed “She Used to Be Mine” from the musical Waitress. She shared in <a href=#>an interview</a> that it was the first Broadway show she ever saw. She later went to see it again in her home city of Toronto, Canada.</p><p>Nicolina also gained a following on TikTok thanks to her cover of the song. Growing up, the singer participated in musical theater. She’s also trained with Darnell Thomas at The Institute for the Performing Arts. Nicolina has appeared in Grease, Mamma Mia!, and more.</p><p>Nicolina shared on the show that her family was close growing up, but things “went downhill” after her parents got a divorce. She said that singing has helped her “use those emotions for the better and not let them get me down.”</p><p>American Idol isn’t the first talent show Nicolina has tried out for. She previously auditioned for America’s Got Talent Season 16, but her audition didn’t air. She shared that a casting producer for American Idol reached out to her about auditioning, and the rest is history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo5eFW1mE8c</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>PAULA ABDUL, RANDY JACKSON WILL RETURN TO ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ NEXT WEEK</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-singer-has-an-ep-out-called-moving-on>The Singer Has an EP Out Called ‘Moving On’</h3><p>Last year, Nicolina released an EP called Moving On, featuring the songs “Take Me Down,” “I Didn’t Love You Anyway,” and “Moving On.” She’s also released her covers of “Everything I Wanted” by Billie Eilish and her audition song “She Used to Be Mine.”</p><p>Nicolina also frequently posts cover performances on her <a href=#>TikTok account</a>.
