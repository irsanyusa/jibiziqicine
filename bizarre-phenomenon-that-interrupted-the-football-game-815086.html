However, what’s more exciting is&nbsp;watching a&nbsp;match where things end up&nbsp;weird. During a&nbsp;match between Austria and Denmark, a&nbsp;mysterious hole popped up&nbsp;from nowhere and stopped the game. The players were furious but also confused by&nbsp;this weird deep hole. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Danish player who brought this to&nbsp;everyone’s attention when his leg got stuck&nbsp;— the hole was deep enough to&nbsp;consume his ankle. Luckily he&nbsp;found it&nbsp;before the game started: such a&nbsp;situation lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;career-ending accident. He&nbsp;was just showing everyone how deep the hole was. On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, the match was delayed by&nbsp;90&nbsp;minutes due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;power outage. The fans were confused: some were frustrated that the team they wanted to&nbsp;support couldn’t play, while others found&nbsp;it... amusing!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bdb/761/d1d02f5631b1f2491d9be4a415.png><p>During a&nbsp;game between Colombia and <a href=# title=Brazil data-link=tag>Brazil</a> at&nbsp;the 2014 World Cup in&nbsp;Brazil, a&nbsp;giant green locust decided to&nbsp;land on&nbsp;James Rodriguez’s arm right after he&nbsp;scored a&nbsp;penalty. The player did not notice it&nbsp;at&nbsp;first. I&nbsp;guess that green guy was a&nbsp;huge football fan or&nbsp;the locust just wanted to&nbsp;congratulate him in&nbsp;its own way. It’s certainly not the first animal to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;football game. Another Brazil-related incident happened when 2&nbsp;local clubs were going head-to-head.</p><p>While the game was in&nbsp;heat, a&nbsp;<a href=# title=dog data-link=tag>dog</a> decided that it&nbsp;wanted a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;the action. It&nbsp;got in&nbsp;the game and furiously went for the ball and turned it&nbsp;into its chew toy. The players were left stunned and agitated with the dog disrupting the flow of&nbsp;the game. Eventually, the officials intervened and spoiled all the fun for our little doggo. In&nbsp;2006, during a&nbsp;Champions League match between Villareal (Vee-yah Rey-yal) and Arsenal, a&nbsp;little grey squirrel zipped across the pitch near the striker. It&nbsp;was also probably just a&nbsp;huge fan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/84b/c10/da6788585db02706e2c56766fe.png><p>Ever heard of&nbsp;a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;foxes invading a&nbsp;pitch? In&nbsp;Dens Park, a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;foxes decided to&nbsp;dig around the pitch probably on&nbsp;the lookout for rabbits. Diego Maradona is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best football players in&nbsp;history. The Argentinean was quick, energetic, and wowed audiences all over the world with his passion. However, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;quarter-final match between <a href=# title=Argentina data-link=tag>Argentina</a> and <a href=# title=England data-link=tag>England</a> during the 1986 World Cup things went too far when he&nbsp;extended his fist in&nbsp;the air and punched the ball only for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;behind the opposition’s net. Much to&nbsp;the fan’s fury, the goal stood! The refs didn’t have a&nbsp;clear vision of&nbsp;the goal even though they should have kept their eyes on&nbsp;the ball. The Argentinians were up&nbsp;by&nbsp;1&nbsp;goal and the match eventually ended 2-1 in&nbsp;favor of&nbsp;the Argentinians. They eventually lifted the Cup which solidified Maradona’s presence as&nbsp;the Greatest Of&nbsp;All Time.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the most unforgettable nights was Brazil vs&nbsp;<a href=# title=Germany data-link=tag>Germany</a> during the 2014 World Cup. Both are giants in&nbsp;the game, both with star-studded players ready to&nbsp;make their country proud. Both teams were crying but for different reasons. Brazil conceded a&nbsp;whopping 7&nbsp;goals on&nbsp;their own turf. The Brazilian fans were furious during this historic moment. Germany ended up&nbsp;lifting the World Cup with Argentina as&nbsp;the runner ups.The Champions League final in&nbsp;2018 between Real (Rey-yal) Madrid and Liverpool was one of&nbsp;the most anticipated games of&nbsp;the year where Liverpool was eyeing victory. Their goalie Loris Karius was in&nbsp;tip-top shape but that night was not his night. The team and fans across the world were shocked when he&nbsp;made not one but two costly mistakes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1eb/2ca/df49d05c8eb73d8772ce7a905f.png><p>The first one was when he&nbsp;accidentally passed the goal to&nbsp;Real Madrid’s striker, Karim Benzema, near the goal. Karius recovered the goal and didn’t see the striker nearby. He&nbsp;miscalculated his pass and awarded the goal to&nbsp;Madrid. The second mistake was when Gareth Bale let loose a&nbsp;curling shot where Karius could’ve easily caught the ball. But instead of&nbsp;that, he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;deflect it&nbsp;and the ball slipped past his hand and into the back of&nbsp;the net. Madrid ended up&nbsp;lifting the Champions League trophy and Karius’s career was just not the same anymore. But it’s cool because Liverpool ended up&nbsp;winning the trophy years later against Tottenham.</p><p>Another strange fiasco happened during the 2014 World Cup qualifier but not everyone saw this game. It&nbsp;was the United States versus Costa Rica and they were playing under some of&nbsp;the worst conditions. It&nbsp;was snowing nonstop and the players were furious. The Costa Rican team even sent out an&nbsp;appeal suggesting that the game should never have been played but was ultimately rejected. Team US&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;winning the match 1-0. Another bizarre scene occurred when a&nbsp;goalkeeper decided to&nbsp;check his phone during the game. The player played for Atlético Paranaense of&nbsp;the Brazilian League. No&nbsp;one knew what he&nbsp;was doing, but it&nbsp;was just impressive that he&nbsp;was wearing his goalkeeper gloves while handling his phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ac2/463/f763f35502822af86f770eb9d9.png><p>There was a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;drama in&nbsp;the match between <a href=# title=France data-link=tag>France</a> and Kuwait on&nbsp;June&nbsp;21, 1982, as&nbsp;the latter were losing 3-1. And just like that, Kuwait conceded another goal. Nothing special except that Kuwait’s leader at&nbsp;the time decided to&nbsp;march down the stands and confront the referee himself in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the ongoing match. He&nbsp;just couldn’t accept the goal and urged the team to&nbsp;leave the pitch. The ref was pressured to&nbsp;disallow the goal and the game continued. They still ended up&nbsp;conceding a&nbsp;goal late in&nbsp;the game. Arsenal has had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;legends in&nbsp;their squad over the decades, but none other than Nicklas Bendtner’s 1.8-second goal can be&nbsp;matched. It’s considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the fastest goal ever scored as&nbsp;a&nbsp;substitute in&nbsp;the Premier League. The Danish striker came in&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sub and headed a&nbsp;corner set up&nbsp;by&nbsp;Cesc Fabregas against their ultimate rivals Tottenham Hotspur.</p><p>Turning your head to&nbsp;check your phone or&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the bathroom when someone scores a&nbsp;goal is&nbsp;always frustrating, but when someone bags a&nbsp;hat trick in&nbsp;70&nbsp;seconds is&nbsp;just on&nbsp;another level frustrating. Alex Torr did that during a&nbsp;match between Rawson Springs and Winn Gardens. The team won the game 7-1 with his goals coming in&nbsp;between the 11th and 13th minutes. The team was not ready for&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/370/229/7a8c7951b9b1bfb5a421053c2a.png><p>One of&nbsp;the weirdest incidents was when a&nbsp;referee awarded a&nbsp;player a&nbsp;red card while being subbed off. To&nbsp;put it&nbsp;into context, the player, Samuel Inkoom, had received a&nbsp;yellow card during the match. The rules of&nbsp;football indicate that any player who takes off their jersey during the game will get a&nbsp;big fat yellow card no&nbsp;matter what. He&nbsp;saw his name to&nbsp;be&nbsp;subbed off and while walking to&nbsp;the dugout, he&nbsp;took off his jersey even though he&nbsp;knew he&nbsp;had the yellow card. But he&nbsp;figured ‘hey, I’m leaving the pitch. What could go&nbsp;wrong.’ An&nbsp;embarrassing moment happened when the ref had to&nbsp;run up&nbsp;to&nbsp;him and show him the second yellow card which turned into a&nbsp;red card, and he&nbsp;was sent off. The player waiting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;subbed in&nbsp;couldn’t play and the team had to&nbsp;1&nbsp;man down.</p><p>It’s a&nbsp;footballer’s dream as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child to&nbsp;play for the biggest clubs in&nbsp;the world. Some players decided to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that a&nbsp;little later. Multiple investigations were in&nbsp;action when they discovered that some people have been lying about their age. For example, Gouray Mukhi claimed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;12&nbsp;years younger than he&nbsp;was. He&nbsp;was 28&nbsp;years old when he&nbsp;told his club he&nbsp;was only 16. A&nbsp;penalty shot is&nbsp;always nerve-racking for both the goalkeeper and the one taking the shot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0b1/af5/ca1d985a9998e533b0fa97589c.png><p>Lionel Messi, the Argentinian superstar, earned a&nbsp;penalty against Cleta Vigo on&nbsp;February 14th, 2016. While it&nbsp;wasn’t exactly a&nbsp;romantic time, no&nbsp;one expected what he’d do&nbsp;next. Instead of&nbsp;casually taking a&nbsp;kick, he&nbsp;ran down the spot and passed the ball to&nbsp;the striker Luis Suarez in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cheeky attempt to&nbsp;confuse the goalie and excite the crowd. It&nbsp;wasn’t the flashiest of&nbsp;moves from Messi who is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the sport’s best players in&nbsp;history, but it&nbsp;will go&nbsp;down in&nbsp;history as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those penalties that will be&nbsp;talked about for a&nbsp;very long time.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK%2BqxsCrqZ5loJ2yr7vMnqWopl2ptaLAjKKlrZ2ip8KxwMSdZK2glWKzsLvTm5ilpF2crq6xjHFobmhoa3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
