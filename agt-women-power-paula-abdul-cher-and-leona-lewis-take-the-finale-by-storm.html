Paula and Leona performed duets with two of this season’s finalists, while Cher delivered a performance all her own.</strong></p><p>This year’s finale was definitely star-studded (and spectacular) thanks to these ladies. Check out videos of the women’s performances below, and find out a little bit more about them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>Paula Abdul performs with Light Balance Kids on “AGT.”</figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Paula Abdul Makes A Surprise ‘AGT’ Appearance</h4><p>AGT teased that Light Balance Kids would be performing with a surprise guest on Wednesday’s show. But who could have guessed that it would be former American Idol judge Paula Abdul?</p><p>Paula’s reveal as one of the light-up dancers shocked her former colleague Simon Cowell. They appeared together in early seasons of American Idol. Paula also had a funny run-in with <a href=#>AGT</a><a href=#> judge Julianne Hough</a> earlier this year at the BBMAs, when she hit her with a hat during her performance.</p><p>Paula was previously a head choreographer for the Laker Girls, before starting her career in music in the late ’80s. She’ll have a Las Vegas residency called Forever Your Girl starting this October.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBfJlZ6HqJ0</p>Cher performs “Waterloo” on the “AGT” finale.</figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Cher Takes The ‘AGT’ Stage</h4><p>Talk about an iconic performance. Cher took the stage in a ’70s-themed performance of ABBA’s “Waterloo.” She was accompanied by a giant disco ball and back-up dancers in retro outfits.</p><p>Cher is a legend in both the music and movie worlds. She started out performing with her then-husband Sonny Bono in the 1960s, and has since become a Grammy-winning solo artist. She’s also appeared in movies like Silkwood and Moonstruck, for which she earned an Oscar.</p><p>Last year, Cher released an album of ABBA covers called Dancing Queen. She’s reportedly working on <a href=#>a follow-up album</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>Leona Lewis and Kodi Lee perform a duet of “You Are the Reason” on “AGT.”</figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Leona Lewis Sings With ‘AGT’ Winner Kodi Lee</h4><p>One of the most memorable performances of the night came from AGT winner Kodi Lee and singer Leona Lewis.
