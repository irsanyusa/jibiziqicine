Just like I have told you several times, I am not in competition with you or anybody else. However, seeing you grant countless interviews where you constantly discredit my effort to the group that we both created and built together speaks volumes. In your recent interviews you claim that you wrote and sang 99% of all P Square songs..."</p><p>The singer's letter also highlighted the personal toll of <a href=# id=e079ce81-0c85-4a71-a101-2a291c9266c2 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>the public feud</a>, including what he describes as ongoing disrespect towards his family, his wife, and himself.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I often find myself wondering what do you truly gain by constantly disrespecting and belittling me all the time. You have disrespected my wife, disrespected my family, disrespected my talent, disrespected my ideas, and even sided with Jude when he was clearly trying to oppress me. Now, if you like, you have taken it further by trying so hard to turn the fans against me by making them believe that I'm jealous of you," he wrote.</p><p>In the detailed letter, Peter emphasised his desire to move forward peacefully and focus on his music, despite the conflict between them.</p><p>The singer added, "I hope you are happy now. I genuinely wish you nothing but the best bro! As for those who believe the lies and false narratives and come to my page to drop negative comments, I understand because you have been fed the wrong narrative for a long time. Please allow me to focus and do my music in peace."</p><p>Peter concluded his letter with a promise to address ongoing legal issues <a href=# id=9ba20735-5fdb-417c-8eca-7e13162b7b41 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>involving the EFCC</a> and the groupâ€™s former manager and elder brother, <strong>Jude Okoye</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGapnaSav2680qqsmqqVYrCiuMusZKitpGK1qr%2BMra6ipl2nwqWxwaiwZqGeYryxsc1mo56spJq%2FcLOVsKOznWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
