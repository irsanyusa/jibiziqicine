This is based on the premise that since the party zoned deputy governorship slot to Edo Central where I am originally from, I should represent various interests in the area.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“This is a gesture I appreciate; it is a good thing for people to recognize your good work and want you to serve especially when one has been supportive without being in government.</p><p>“I want to make it clear that the position of deputy governorship is not a position one campaigns for, the party leaders alongside members chose who flies the party’s ticket alongside the governorship candidate. However, I am available to serve in whatever capacity the party wants me to serve.&nbsp; I am a loyal party member.</p><p>“Most importantly, the people of Edo State deserve much more than what they are getting from the present government.</p><p>“Good governance is not what is seen on the pages of newspapers, good governance reflects in the lives of the governed. People of Edo State can testify themselves if they have gotten the best from the present government. The people know they got the wrong end of the stick. Good governance is not PR, it is value-adding.</p><p>“In whatever way things swing in Edo State, I am an interested stakeholder in the happenings in my state and a visionary individual who believes good leadership coupled with youthfulness can turn the whole of Nigeria and Edo State around without unnecessary noise.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“I will continue to engage relevant stakeholders in Edo State regarding this matter.</p><p>“I once again appreciate the various youth associations, students union, all the higher institutions in Edo State and women who want me to show interest in the upcoming election.</p><p>“I will continue to help my people with or without political power as I have always done without being in government. I believe in the popular saying that, ‘ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country” read the statement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGamnaKYxm62zqGlrKeeYq6kwNGeqqxlmKrAo63NnWSsqJWWuLR5zqdknpyfYrGmvNStsGafn6uys7rOq2SrmZOafLp91p1rb20%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
