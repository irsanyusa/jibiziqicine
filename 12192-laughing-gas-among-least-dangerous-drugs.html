Several Premier League footballers, including Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling, and various TV personalities have been photographed inhaling the legal high out of balloons, often beneath <a href=#>headlines</a> describing the behaviour as ‘<a href=#>shameful</a>’.</p><p>But new YouGov research reveals that British people see laughing gas as relatively safe, and many have used it.</p><p>22% of under-40s and 14% of over-40s have inhaled laughing gas from a balloon, while it is seen as safe by 22%, putting it just behind cannabis (28%) and alcohol (48%). 35% of under-40s see laughing gas as safe compared to 15% of over-40s.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/drugs_CH5kEit.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Magic mushrooms are seen as the fourth safest drug, with a safe score of net -67, and tobacco the fifth safest (net -71).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/hipcr.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The poll suggests the media’s choice of wording in calling the drug ‘hippy crack’ may be spreading extra concern, as many (46%) don’t know what the term refers to and 32% think it refers to drugs that many see as more dangerous than laughing gas. 18% correctly identify the reference as laughing gas, but 15% think it is LSD (net -82 safety) and 13% think it is crack cocaine (cocaine has a net safety score of -87).</p><p>The gas, known scientifically as nitrous oxide, is legitimately used in dental procedures and childbirth for pain relief, however <a href=#>there is concern</a> that its recreational use – which involves repeatedly inhaling from a balloon – can lead to oxygen deprivation and loss of blood pressure. The gas was <a href=#>first synthesised in 1772</a>, and was used recreationally for almost 200 years before beginning its life as an anaesthetic in the mid-19th Century.</p><p><strong><a href=#>See the full poll results</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpYmaGc3nLmqygoJmjtG6zwKxkmqWfo7RuuMSaqq1llJa7qLHRqKysZZSnwqi%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
