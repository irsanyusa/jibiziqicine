Germany boasts Europe’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">largest economy</a> and is the world’s third-largest export nation, so it’s a great place to study business. A German MBA will give you a global perspective and allow you to build an international network as part of a vibrant community of students.&nbsp;</p><p>Read on as we explore the requirements for acceptance and highlight some of the best MBA programs available. We’ll also shed light on whether you can work during your studies and how much MBA programs in Germany cost.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Acceptance-into-an-MBA-program-in-Germany>Acceptance into an MBA program in Germany</h2><p>German universities offer a wide range of MBA programs, so there is no single set of requirements for admission. However, there are some key conditions candidates should meet. Most universities expect applicants to hold a bachelor’s degree and to have earned a competitive score on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT).&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, work experience is often required, as is a high level of proficiency in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>. Yes, you can do an MBA in Germany in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>! Even so, it’s strongly recommended to start <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning German</a> or at least have a basic grasp of the language before your MBA begins. Speaking German will help with networking opportunities and make it easier for you to navigate daily life in the country.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you need a visa to study for an MBA in Germany? Yes, if you are not a citizen of the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area. All non-German citizens also need to apply for a residence permit. You can find detailed information on visa requirements from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German embassy</a> or consulate in your home country.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-best-MBA-programs-in-Germany>The best MBA programs in Germany</h2><p>Anyone wanting to study an MBA program in Germany won’t lack for choice. The country is home to many exceptional programs at renowned <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">universities</a>. Here are some of our top picks.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1.

The school maintains partnerships with over <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">100 companies</a> and focuses on professional and personal growth in a diverse community.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2.

Most international students in Germany are allowed to work <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">part-time</a> on a student visa — though you should always check regulations with your local embassy. (EU/EEA citizens have no restrictions on work.) Working while you study can help you expand your professional network and practice skills you’re learning in a real-life environment. Of course, it can also supplement your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">income</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of money, how much does an MBA cost in Germany? Tuition-free MBAs are hard to find in Germany; it’s highly likely that you’ll need to pay. Fees vary widely, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">starting</a> at around €10,000 per year and going up to almost €50,000 per year. To take two examples, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Saarland University</a> offers an MBA for €12,000 per year; an MBA at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mannheim Business </a>School will set you back €42,000. Many universities offer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">scholarships</a>, and you may find other organizations offering scholarships, too.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready to do an MBA in Germany?</h2><p>Doing an MBA in Germany offers an immersive experience for professionals with a global outlook.
