However, sometimes the obtained results are not exactly as&nbsp;expected, and actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jennifer Grey</a> knows what this means firsthand. Today, the 62-year-old is&nbsp;opening up&nbsp;about the one procedure ’’from hell’’ that had an&nbsp;ever-lasting impact on&nbsp;her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>. But she’s also sharing how time taught her to&nbsp;carry on&nbsp;and look at&nbsp;the bright side of&nbsp;things.</p><p><h2>Her mom told her to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;nose job.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/785/6eb/8045735bc4bbb4daf77f8dde2f.jpg><p>M.G.M/UNITED ARTIST / Album/EAST NEWS</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Having</a> an&nbsp;Oscar-winning <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a> for a&nbsp;dad and a&nbsp;famous singer and actress for a&nbsp;mom, Jennifer Grey wasn’t a&nbsp;stranger to&nbsp;the movie industry and wanted to&nbsp;follow in&nbsp;her parents’ footsteps as&nbsp;she grew&nbsp;up. But the aspiring actress’s mother, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jo&nbsp;Wilder</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suggested</a> she undergo rhinoplasty if&nbsp;she wanted to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;career out of&nbsp;being under the spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17d/06f/9208e25f29a724d1b46a2cacd6.jpg><p>Grey <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a> her mama’s advice: “It’s too hard to&nbsp;cast you. Make it&nbsp;easier for them.” And even though at&nbsp;the time the young woman was upset by&nbsp;her mom’s words, she now admits, “She loves&nbsp;me, loved&nbsp;me, always has, and she was pragmatic.”</p><p>After all, both her mom and her dad had nose jobs, and they knew what it&nbsp;would take to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>. However, young Grey resisted the idea of&nbsp;getting the procedure and explained, “I&nbsp;was completely anti-rhinoplasty.”</p><p><h2>Mega-fame, then deception</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c20/eca/b24b1d5035b5d87f4370f7ec41.jpg><p>Little did she know back then, fame was waiting for her just around the corner, and her life was about to&nbsp;be&nbsp;completely transformed. In&nbsp;fact, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;27, Grey was catapulted to&nbsp;worldwide fame after being cast as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;main characters in&nbsp;the coming-of-age 1987&nbsp;movie,<i> </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Dirty Dancing</i></a><i>. </i>She starred as&nbsp;“Baby” Houseman, a&nbsp;young woman who falls in&nbsp;love with her dance instructor, played by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Patrick Swayze</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/82f/461/9f39be5d19bdb1eb488a89babf.jpg><p>And although Grey became the biggest star in&nbsp;Hollywood for a&nbsp;while thanks to&nbsp;the colossal success of&nbsp;the movie, her career, however, didn’t explode as&nbsp;some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expected</a>.</p><p><h2>Becoming unrecognizable</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c3/242/1310aa5460a45138f47c4a1a12.jpg><p>Mary Evans/AF Archive/Graham Whitby Boot/East News</p><p>This is&nbsp;when Grey finally gave in&nbsp;to&nbsp;the idea of&nbsp;going under the knife. She had her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> nose job shorty after <i>Dirty Dancing</i>, followed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;second rhinoplasty a&nbsp;little while later. But she explained that this decision has had a&nbsp;transformative impact on&nbsp;her.</p><p>She revealed that her face had changed so&nbsp;much after the second procedure, that actor <a href=# title="Michael Douglas" data-link=tag>Michael Douglas</a> didn’t even recognize her during a&nbsp;movie premiere. Grey realized the irreversible effect this transformation would have on&nbsp;her future. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, “And it&nbsp;became the thing, the idea of&nbsp;being completely invisible from one day to&nbsp;the next. In&nbsp;the world’s eyes, I&nbsp;was no&nbsp;longer&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Her career was also affected.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d30/809/a625265721bdb42c288bf8e462.jpg><p>For a&nbsp;long time after the surgery, the actress regretted her decision, which she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>calls</a> “the nose job from hell.” She believes that losing her trademark nose adversely affected her career and prevented her from becoming a&nbsp;more successful actress. She opened&nbsp;up, saying, “I&nbsp;went into the ­operating room a&nbsp;celebrity and came out anonymous.”</p><p>She later had small guest spots in&nbsp;shows, such as&nbsp;<i>Friends </i>and <i>House</i>, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;TV movies, like <i>A&nbsp;Case for Murder </i>and <i>Eyes of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Witness.</i> In&nbsp;2010, success finally came knocking at&nbsp;her door again when she won<i> Dancing with the Stars</i>.</p><p><h2>She’s now fulfilled and thriving.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/642/510/1dacf0510bb8eb75ce316561db.jpg><p>Today, at&nbsp;62, the actress is&nbsp;more comfortable in&nbsp;her skin than ever before. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>notes</a>, “I’ve never felt what I’m feeling these days.” She positively exclaims, “I&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;my&nbsp;heart that the second half of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman’s life is&nbsp;the best half.” As&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact, these days, Grey is&nbsp;busy and thriving. She has written her memoir and is&nbsp;even working on&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>Dirty Dancing</i> sequel, 35&nbsp;years after the first one made her famous.</p><p>Moreover, she has now reached inner peace after having reflected on&nbsp;her past decisions and the reason why she was kept away from Hollywood. She says, “I&nbsp;spent so&nbsp;much energy trying to&nbsp;figure out what&nbsp;I did wrong, why&nbsp;I was banished from the kingdom.” She adds, “That’s a&nbsp;lie. I&nbsp;banished myself.”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;Jennifer Grey’s story?
