So, it’s important to&nbsp;be&nbsp;well-informed about how this actually works. It’s not just about finding the motivation to&nbsp;get off the couch and work out. There are several things to&nbsp;take into account when trying to&nbsp;<a href=# title="lose weight" data-link=tag>lose weight</a>. Some of&nbsp;them are the type of&nbsp;<a href=# title=workout data-link=tag>workout</a> you’ll be&nbsp;doing, the duration, the intensity, and even your current weight. All of&nbsp;these things can have an&nbsp;effect on&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;calories you burn in&nbsp;every training session. That’s why Harvard University came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<a href=#>list</a> that tells you how many calories you burn according to&nbsp;your weight in&nbsp;30&nbsp;minutes of&nbsp;practicing different sports and exercises.</p><p>And because <strong>Bright Side</strong> wants you to&nbsp;lead a&nbsp;healthy and happy life, we&nbsp;made a&nbsp;compilation with some of&nbsp;the most popular sports and exercises that were included on&nbsp;Harvard’s list, so&nbsp;that you can calculate how many calories you’re burning every time you work out.</p><p><h2>1. Jumping rope</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/862/1a0/2f88e85f9281b8cbb1ad802f65.jpg><p><a href=#>Jumping rope</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;activity that can be&nbsp;practiced at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age. We’re used to&nbsp;seeing kids doing this in&nbsp;the park or&nbsp;on&nbsp;the street. However, it&nbsp;can also be&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent physical exercise when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;burning calories as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult. You can jump rope as&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;your warm-up routine because it&nbsp;helps to&nbsp;improve your coordination and rhythm, strengthens your heart and lungs, and tones the muscles in&nbsp;your arms, legs, chest, and shoulders. Depending on&nbsp;what <a href=#>your weight&nbsp;is</a>, this exercise burns a&nbsp;different amount of&nbsp;calories: 300&nbsp;if you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 372&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 444&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>2. Swimming</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e0/827/6ddad35fbab0f48e7a9aa44e63.jpg><p>Depending on&nbsp;what type of&nbsp;technique you use, <a href=#>swimming</a> can be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most complete sports that humans can practice. Practicing this sport has many benefits: it&nbsp;puts all the muscles in&nbsp;your body to&nbsp;work, improves your cognitive functions, and strengthens both your lungs and your heart. Being a&nbsp;low-impact sport, people can exercise longer without much effort and without experiencing joint or&nbsp;muscle pain. That is&nbsp;why it’s a&nbsp;safe activity for people who have suffered from injuries in&nbsp;the past or&nbsp;for pregnant women. When practicing this sport, depending on&nbsp;what <a href=#>your weight&nbsp;is</a>, you burn 180 calories if&nbsp;you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 223&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 266&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>3. Walking (3.5&nbsp;mph)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e44/dda/aa21615c3386aedd79017d5c62.jpg><p>Walking is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the physical activities that people do&nbsp;many times a&nbsp;day, every day. When you go&nbsp;for a&nbsp;walk, you burn calories without even realizing that you are doing&nbsp;so. That’s what makes it&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent option to&nbsp;lose weight. That, and the fact that most of&nbsp;the time it&nbsp;doesn’t really require any special type of&nbsp;equipment. Depending on&nbsp;what <a href=#>your weight&nbsp;is</a>, walking at&nbsp;3.5 mph burns a&nbsp;different amount of&nbsp;calories: 120&nbsp;if you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 149&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 178&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>4. Soccer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/316/7eb/3297e5548999d167e4a708c075.jpg><p><a href=#>Soccer</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;team sport where 11&nbsp;team players play together against a&nbsp;rival team of&nbsp;11&nbsp;other players. Each player has a&nbsp;different position. Because the size of&nbsp;the field can vary, the amount of&nbsp;calories burnt while playing will depend on&nbsp;its size as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the position that you play. For example, a&nbsp;goalkeeper burns fewer calories because of&nbsp;the obvious constraints of&nbsp;his or&nbsp;her position. Generally speaking, when playing <a href=# title=soccer data-link=tag>soccer</a> and depending on&nbsp;what your weight&nbsp;is, you burn 210 calories if&nbsp;you <a href=#>weigh</a> 125&nbsp;pounds, 260&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 311&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>5. Basketball</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ac/322/70dc485ca094eaa70740653d63.jpg><p><a href=#>Basketball</a> is&nbsp;another team sport, however, in&nbsp;this case, there are only 5&nbsp;players on&nbsp;each team. To&nbsp;calculate the number of&nbsp;calories burned by&nbsp;playing this sport, one should consider what the intensity of&nbsp;the particular match was and take into account the size of&nbsp;the court. Still, it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;kept in&nbsp;mind that unlike soccer, <a href=# title=basketball data-link=tag>basketball</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sport that requires more contact, but in&nbsp;both games speed, coordination, and teamwork are essential to&nbsp;score and ultimately win the match. When playing basketball and depending on&nbsp;<a href=#>what your weight&nbsp;is</a>, you burn 240 calories if&nbsp;you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 298&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 355&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>6. Stationary bicycling</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e5d/c9d/e992fa5991912f3db03f9d5bb1.jpg><p>The <a href=#>spinning bicycle</a> or&nbsp;stationary bicycle is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great alternative to&nbsp;mountain biking. Thanks to&nbsp;this piece of&nbsp;equipment, you can enjoy the benefits of&nbsp;biking without the cardiovascular and joint impact that it&nbsp;can have. Whether you have enrolled in&nbsp;a&nbsp;gym class or&nbsp;you’ve decided to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;the challenge of&nbsp;biking from the comfort of&nbsp;your own home, keep the motivation up&nbsp;and do&nbsp;your daily training session with the help of&nbsp;this equipment. When using a&nbsp;stationary bicycle and depending on&nbsp;<a href=#>what your weight is</a>&nbsp;and how vigorously you do&nbsp;the exercise, you burn 210 calories if&nbsp;you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 260&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 311&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>7. Running (5&nbsp;mph)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8c/4e4/ff363f50248cbe0e46b9aa7581.jpg><p>Just like walking, running is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty straightforward activity that is&nbsp;accessible to&nbsp;many people. Generally speaking, you don’t need a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;special equipment. A&nbsp;good pair of&nbsp;sneakers will take you a&nbsp;long way. You can go&nbsp;out to&nbsp;the park, to&nbsp;an&nbsp;athletic track, run on&nbsp;the street, or&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;stationary treadmill. If&nbsp;you’ve never done much exercise or&nbsp;haven’t done it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;while, running is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good place to&nbsp;start getting back on&nbsp;track. Remember that the number of&nbsp;calories you burn will depend on&nbsp;how fast you are running. Depending on&nbsp;what <a href=#>your weight&nbsp;is</a>, running at&nbsp;5&nbsp;mph burns a&nbsp;different amount of&nbsp;calories: 240&nbsp;if you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 298&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 355&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>8. Elliptical trainer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c19/a89/0045715194b3c97a232bd8891e.jpg><p>An&nbsp;<a href=#>elliptical trainer</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;machine that allows you to&nbsp;practice aerobics without having to&nbsp;leave the spot where the equipment is&nbsp;set. The 2&nbsp;pedals and the vertical bars help you make a&nbsp;movement that resembles Nordic skiing. You can work out at&nbsp;the gym or&nbsp;at&nbsp;home with the help of&nbsp;this equipment and start losing weight by&nbsp;burning calories in&nbsp;the process. When using an&nbsp;elliptical trainer and depending on&nbsp;what <a href=#>your weight&nbsp;is</a>, you burn 270 calories if&nbsp;you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 335&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 400&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>9. Tennis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0dc/7ed/5ecb155629a59453f8eb622914.jpg><p><a href=#>Tennis</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sport that can be&nbsp;played with just 2&nbsp;players (singles) or&nbsp;with 2&nbsp;couples (doubles). A&nbsp;given match of&nbsp;<a href=# title=tennis data-link=tag>tennis</a> has no&nbsp;fixed duration since the purpose of&nbsp;the game is&nbsp;to&nbsp;win 2&nbsp;sets (the best of&nbsp;out of&nbsp;3) or&nbsp;3&nbsp;sets (the best of&nbsp;5). In&nbsp;fact, the <a href=#>longest</a> match in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;tennis lasted around 11&nbsp;hours and 5&nbsp;minutes. You can then imagine that the number of&nbsp;calories burned can vary a&nbsp;lot depending on&nbsp;the intensity and duration of&nbsp;the game. In&nbsp;half an&nbsp;hour of&nbsp;playing tennis, and depending on&nbsp;what <a href=#>your weight&nbsp;is</a>, you burn 210 calories if&nbsp;you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 260&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 311&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>10. Weightlifting</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b8d/793/3e51495c7a93fd72ca5015b171.jpg><p>Olympic weightlifting, mostly known as&nbsp;simply weightlifting is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strength <a href=#>sport</a> that requires thorough and formal training by&nbsp;the athlete in&nbsp;question in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;safely. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;that, it&nbsp;requires great mental strength and uses all the muscles in&nbsp;the body. You need special equipment to&nbsp;practice this sport: a&nbsp;bar, discs, platforms, etc. Depending on&nbsp;what your <a href=#>weight&nbsp;is</a>, when practicing weightlifting you’ll burn 90&nbsp;calories if&nbsp;you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 112 simply 155&nbsp;pounds, and 133 simply 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>11. Hatha yoga</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ef/9a0/80186e5bdea052c64401c4f626.jpg><p><a href=#>Hatha yoga</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific type of&nbsp;yoga that focuses more on&nbsp;what is&nbsp;known as&nbsp;asanas or&nbsp;postures. The benefits of&nbsp;this practice include more elasticity and firmness of&nbsp;the muscles involved in&nbsp;the practice, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;more awareness and control of&nbsp;breathing. In&nbsp;half an&nbsp;hour, depending on&nbsp;what <a href=#>your weight&nbsp;is</a>, practicing hatha yoga burns a&nbsp;different amount of&nbsp;calories: 120&nbsp;if you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 149&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 178&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>12. Dancing: slow, waltz, foxtrot</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/caa/29d/8b066d5f599f4d18d48054a47e.jpg><p><a href=#>Dance</a> uses body movements as&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;expression and social interaction. It&nbsp;has served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;communication, artistic expression, and physical activity for many years. Depending on&nbsp;the type of&nbsp;dance you practice, you will burn more or&nbsp;fewer calories. Harvard made its calculations with slow dancing, foxtrot, and waltz, which are styles that require fewer calories because of&nbsp;their slow and smooth movements. Depending on&nbsp;what <a href=#>your weight&nbsp;is</a>, when dancing these styles you can burn a&nbsp;different amount of&nbsp;calories: 90&nbsp;if you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 112&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 133&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>13. Volleyball</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebf/7d3/0d2cb35d4aa4c381f026b22274.jpg><p><a href=#>Volleyball</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;team sport where each team consists of&nbsp;6&nbsp;players. Players can touch the ball with any part of&nbsp;their bodies. However, what makes volleyball so&nbsp;unique, and so&nbsp;different from basketball and soccer, for example, is&nbsp;that players have to&nbsp;keep changing their positions while they’re scoring points. This sport, besides burning calories, improves concentration, tones the muscles, and helps improve coordination. When you play volleyball you <a href=#>burn</a> up&nbsp;to&nbsp;90&nbsp;calories if&nbsp;you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 112&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and finally 133&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>14. Aerobics</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4d0/31c/ef217b54a8b0eb71fe8eecb8c6.jpg><p><a href=#>Aerobics</a> are a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;gymnastics that incorporates music as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the routine. As&nbsp;its name indicates, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;aerobic exercise that strengthens physical capacities by&nbsp;working on&nbsp;rhythm, flexibility, coordination, orientation, etc. But in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;that, it&nbsp;improves cardiovascular function and lung capacity. When practicing this physical activity, you <a href=#>burn</a> different amounts of&nbsp;calories depending on&nbsp;your weight: 165&nbsp;if you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 205&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and 244&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>15. Stationary rowing</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/681/5bc/1fb48b515b94fdfe734a0bec4e.jpg><p>And last but not least, stationary rowing, where the main equipment is&nbsp;known as&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>ergometer</a>, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;device that replicates rowing outdoors without you having to&nbsp;get into the water. That’s what makes it&nbsp;great: you don’t need a&nbsp;paddle or&nbsp;a&nbsp;canoe to&nbsp;practice the sport. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;that, it’s considered a&nbsp;pretty well-rounded sport, since it&nbsp;requires you to&nbsp;move several muscle groups. When you practice stationary rowing, you <a href=#>burn</a> up&nbsp;to&nbsp;210 calories if&nbsp;you weigh 125&nbsp;pounds, 260&nbsp;if you weigh 155&nbsp;pounds, and finally 311&nbsp;if you weigh 185&nbsp;pounds.</p><p>The data provided is&nbsp;an&nbsp;estimation.
