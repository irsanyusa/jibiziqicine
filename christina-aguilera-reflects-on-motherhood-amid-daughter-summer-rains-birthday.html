Amid the special occasion, the singer pondered upon what it means to be a mother.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Christina Aguilera Celebrates Daughter Summer Rain’s 9th Birthday</h2><p>In a series of snaps and a video posted last Wednesday, Aguilera greeted her youngest child a happy birthday. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Genie in a Bottle” singer</a> uploaded the slideshow alongside a long and contemplative greeting for Summer Rain.</p><p>“Happy 9th birthday to our sweet Summer Rain,” she wrote. “Today I find myself reflecting on how fast time has gone by. These 9 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">years</a> have been filled with boundless love, heartwarming hugs, staying up too late, Disney adventures, and most recently, the joy of gracing the stage alongside you.”</p><p>In Aguilera’s feature photos, Summer was wearing black shorts and a black graphic T-shirt. The little girl can be seen facing a bunch of people with her mom. In another snap, Summer was posing behind a drum set while donning a white T-shirt.</p><p>According to the singer, she expresses gratitude to the universe everyday for the privilege of motherhood. She went on and stated that being a mom remains to be her “ultimate accomplishment.”</p><p>“Witnessing the remarkable young woman you are evolving into fills me with immense pride. Mommy loves you so much!,” Aguilera wrote.</p><p>The hitmaker shares Summer with her fiancé, film producer Matt Rutler. She is also mom to her 15-year-old son Max Liron whom she shares with her ex-husband, music producer Jordan Bratman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-tries-to-learn-hairdressing-for-her-daughter>She Tries to Learn Hairdressing for Her Daughter</h2><p>For Aguilera, having a daughter means learning how to be a hairdresser as well. The performer revealed last March that Summer has “pushed” her to train doing hair.&nbsp;</p><p>“She likes to put these little pigtail braids in. So every morning I’m up with her before school, trying to use a spiky comb to split her hair in the back,” she said. “I am no hairdresser, let me tell you, but God bless being a mom, and we’ll do anything to make our kids feel good.”</p><p>Raising a daughter in the age of social media, the singer wants to take the stigma out of shame around beauty. For her, she owes it to Summer to instill the message that she’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful</a> — “no matter what they say.”</p><p>“There are many things that we worry about, especially as moms with social media, but I think that one of the positives is that we can really support each other, share information, and gain a lot of insight from it,” she said.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_1DerekHough_NicoleScherzinger_Kelsey-McNeal_Disney-General-Entertainment-Content-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="All Winners of ‘Dancing With The Stars’ Seasons 1 Through 31" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>christina aguilera</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqGpoquknruiecCgrKKklaeubr7En6Oem6SoerC6jKamraCVp7Wwu8NmmKahlGKxosHGoaueql2owq65xKtkq5mZo8Bursirq6Gcka58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
