I&nbsp;(30F) own two small businesses with my&nbsp;husband, and we&nbsp;work hard, long hours. My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;miscarriage last year and were overjoyed to&nbsp;find out we&nbsp;were pregnant again. My&nbsp;parents were so&nbsp;excited and were way more loving and attentive than they’ve ever been. That&nbsp;is, until my&nbsp;sister announced she was also pregnant. With twins.</p><p>I&nbsp;have been supportive of&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister but was secretly devastated we’d be&nbsp;pregnant at&nbsp;the same time because&nbsp;I knew my&nbsp;parents would not care about my&nbsp;pregnancy and my&nbsp;child would constantly be&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister’s kids for his entire life. They’re due about 35&nbsp;days apart, but my&nbsp;sister is&nbsp;having an&nbsp;elective C-section and has moved the date back farther each month so&nbsp;that we’re now due six days apart.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d83/a16/8ddbbc5809afc1bf5a34c27a4f.jpg><p>«My&nbsp;friends and husband thought&nbsp;I was overreacting, until it&nbsp;was time for my&nbsp;baby shower. We&nbsp;live out of&nbsp;state, but my&nbsp;mom promised a&nbsp;virtual shower and we&nbsp;picked a&nbsp;date. I&nbsp;work a&nbsp;lot, so&nbsp;I figured it&nbsp;was handled. I&nbsp;followed up&nbsp;a&nbsp;few times and was told they were figuring it&nbsp;out, and then was like, „Oh, the date is&nbsp;almost here!“ I&nbsp;called my&nbsp;mom to&nbsp;find out if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was happening, but she didn’t answer.</p><p>The day of&nbsp;the baby shower came and nothing. And then, my&nbsp;mom texted me&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful, elaborate invitation to&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister’s baby shower in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few weeks. That’s it. She never called me&nbsp;back or&nbsp;anything. I&nbsp;realized that she completely forgot about it&nbsp;altogether.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband no&nbsp;longer thinks I’ve overreacted, and we&nbsp;are now assuming neither of&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents will be&nbsp;coming to&nbsp;help with the baby or&nbsp;have much interest at&nbsp;all. I’ve worked really hard in&nbsp;therapy to&nbsp;forgive and learn to&nbsp;deal with my&nbsp;family because&nbsp;I want my&nbsp;son to&nbsp;have grandparents and cousins, but&nbsp;I don’t know if&nbsp;I want either of&nbsp;us to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;family system where we&nbsp;don’t matter. I&nbsp;know how that feels already.</p><p>Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;overreacting or&nbsp;being hormonal? I&nbsp;didn’t help plan the shower and wasn’t adamant about&nbsp;it, but&nbsp;I checked my&nbsp;texts and both me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;husband have messages from them saying they were doing&nbsp;it. Between my&nbsp;family issues/history and being pregnant, I&nbsp;just don’t trust my&nbsp;own judgement.»</p><p><h2>Although she was having doubts about her feelings, people in&nbsp;the comments assured she was right to&nbsp;feel neglected by&nbsp;her family and offered advice on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;deal with&nbsp;it:</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e9/35e/92438a521d80f3d0b7ccaa06e1.jpg><ul><li>You are not overreacting one bit. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;one thing for her to&nbsp;not be&nbsp;good at&nbsp;that sort of&nbsp;thing and forget, but this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole other level. She made beautiful invitations for your sister and did not even answer the phone when you attempted to&nbsp;contact her. Your sister is&nbsp;her priority, and you need to&nbsp;move on&nbsp;from them because as&nbsp;sad as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is, you won’t be&nbsp;the priority.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;KaleidoscopeDan&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>The damage that will be&nbsp;done to&nbsp;your son by&nbsp;being constantly (negatively) compared to&nbsp;his cousins is&nbsp;much greater than any loss he&nbsp;could possibly feel by&nbsp;not having grandparents. One day he&nbsp;will be&nbsp;old enough to&nbsp;understand and if&nbsp;he&nbsp;so&nbsp;chooses he&nbsp;could meet them and will quickly learn why you chose to&nbsp;protect him from them.<br>You have achieved so&nbsp;much, and you still get no&nbsp;recognition from them&nbsp;— nothing is&nbsp;ever going to&nbsp;change. Stop wasting your energy. Go&nbsp;and make a&nbsp;happy life without all of&nbsp;them&nbsp;— and take back all the time and money you would have spent on&nbsp;them for yourselves and invest it&nbsp;in&nbsp;your own future.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;cathysclown76&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;was the kid of&nbsp;the parents that got ignored, while my&nbsp;cousins and their parents were just everything to&nbsp;my&nbsp;grandparents. Don’t let your parents treat them second. My&nbsp;father regrets to&nbsp;this day for not telling his parents off for ignoring&nbsp;us and praising their other grandchildren.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Dmau27&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>No, no&nbsp;you’re not overreacting. But you’re also not going to&nbsp;change them, no&nbsp;matter how many times you explain how their favoritism hurts you, or&nbsp;later&nbsp;on, your kids.<br>Speaking from the other side of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mess that on&nbsp;the surface, sounded similar to&nbsp;this&nbsp;— let them take themselves out of&nbsp;your life and don’t count on&nbsp;them. Focus on&nbsp;the people that matter, that are in&nbsp;your life day in&nbsp;and day out. I&nbsp;know it&nbsp;sucks, but honestly, it’s better in&nbsp;the long run if&nbsp;the kids are never attached to&nbsp;them emotionally. I&nbsp;learned that the hard way.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;neverenoughpurple&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>They have made it&nbsp;clear what their priorities are, and you’re not&nbsp;it. It’s time to&nbsp;let&nbsp;go. Don’t send them a&nbsp;long email or&nbsp;try to&nbsp;call and explain your hurt feelings, because they won’t care.<br>You don’t need to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;big dramatic scene, just stop reaching out. Stop sharing your life with them. Don’t respond to&nbsp;the invite, don’t reach out to&nbsp;your sister or&nbsp;to&nbsp;find out about the baby, just remove yourself from their lives.<br>They may realize what they’ve done and try to&nbsp;make amends, and it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;you to&nbsp;decide to&nbsp;give them a&nbsp;second chance or&nbsp;not. Either way, you need to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;your real family: your husband, your new baby, the friends you’ve chosen. It’s time to&nbsp;stop wasting energy on&nbsp;people who don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;your life.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Unknown author&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;feel, at&nbsp;this point, you should silently disappear. I&nbsp;mean, you were overlooked anyway. And your sister is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wanting for anything, and you really don’t owe her anything. Do&nbsp;not respond to&nbsp;the RSVP. Do&nbsp;not tell them you’re in&nbsp;labor. Block on&nbsp;social media.<br>Just disappear. Ignore calls and just learn from the experience. Treat your son like you’ve always wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated. Give him the world. You really don’t need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the scapegoat anymore. You’re free.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Keopikwin&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Pregnancy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sensitive time, one that should be&nbsp;mostly filled with peace, comfort and privacy, particularly when the moment to&nbsp;give birth arrives. Unfortunately, that’s not what happened to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new mom, who had to&nbsp;endure an&nbsp;incredibly stressful birth because of&nbsp;how her mother-in-law acted.
