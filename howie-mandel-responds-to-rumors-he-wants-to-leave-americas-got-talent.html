The 67-year-old actor and comedian has entertained audiences and contestants with his humor, wit, and unique brand of humor. However, as Mandel’s tenure on the show extends into its second decade, fans and industry insiders have been speculating about how much longer he plans to continue as a judge on the talent competition.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-howie-mandel-opens-up-about-leaving-america-s-got-talent>Howie Mandel Opens Up About Leaving America’s Got Talent</h2><p>Howie Mandel recently opened up about his thoughts about leaving <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent</a> with fellow comedian Fred Armisen on his podcast, Howie Mandel Does Stuff. The discussion took an interesting turn when they delved into the topic of leaving long-running television shows.</p><p>The guest, who was a cast member on Saturday Night Live from 2002 to 2013, shared his perspective on knowing when it’s time to move on. Mandel, intrigued by the subject, then considered his own position on AGT.</p><p>“This is my fourteenth season on AGT. I can’t imagine leaving,” He further elaborated, expressing his desire for the decision to be out of his hands, saying, “I want to be fired, or let go.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>For those who may not know, Mandel’s journey on AGT began in Season 5 when he joined the show as a judge. His arrival coincided with the departure of David Hasselhoff, who left to work on a TV series.</p><p>Mandel’s tenure on the show has since made him the longest-serving judge in the show’s history. Alongside Mandel, AGT features beloved judges, Simon Cowell, Sofia Vergara, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heidi Klum</a>, with Terry Crews serving as the show’s host. Mandel is currently filming AGT’s newest spin off, AGT Fantasy League with Cowell, Klum, and Mel B.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-is-a-prominent-figure-on-other-got-talent-game-shows>He is a Prominent Figure on Other Got Talent, Game Shows</h2><p>In addition to his role on AGT, Mandel holds a judging position on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Canada’s Got Talent</a>. In the Canadian counterpart of the popular show, Mandel, alongside fellow judges Kardinal Offishall, Lilly Singh, and Trish Stratus, continues to showcase his keen eye for talent and his distinctive humor.</p><p>Mandel’s influence on the world of entertainment doesn’t end with AGT and CGT.
