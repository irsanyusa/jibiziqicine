I have noted, however, that . . . [you failed to] mention the very interesting fact that when General Allen (then in command of the 2nd Battalion of the 358th Infantry) got the machine-gun bullet through his jaws and mouth at Aincreville during the St. Mihiel offensive, he was more infuriated than hurt and, in his very characteristic style, insisted that he wanted to get to a German soldier with his bare hands. It was not surprising, therefore, that Terry charged a machine-gun nest (something that he properly should have left to his men to do and which they were doing all around him) and after shooting one gunner, jumped into the emplacement and hit another one with his fist, knocking out the Boche by hand and splintering his own hand or wrist, incapacitating himself more thereby than the machine-gun bullet previously had. . . .</p><p>Yes, Terry Allen was a fighter . . . and best of all, he was a leader, organizer and inspirer who will honor his ist Division and I am sure his Army Corps later, as they will in turn honor him.</p><p>Many are the tales we who served with him in 1918 could tell you but you have told his story as a whole magnificently.</p><p>H.
