Attention! Residents of&nbsp;all countries and cities of&nbsp;the world! A&nbsp;massive asteroid is&nbsp;approaching the <a href=# title=Earth data-link=tag>Earth</a>. Now its speed is&nbsp;several times greater than the speed of&nbsp;sound, and each day it&nbsp;accelerates even more.</p><p>Once it&nbsp;enters our <a href=# title="solar system" data-link=tag>solar system</a>, it&nbsp;will fly past Uranus, <a href=# title=Saturn data-link=tag>Saturn</a>, <a href=# title=Jupiter data-link=tag>Jupiter</a>, and <a href=# title=Mars data-link=tag>Mars</a>. The gravitational fields of&nbsp;these planets will also accelerate the asteroid. And our planet will be&nbsp;the final destination! A&nbsp;collision is&nbsp;inevitable.</p><p>According to&nbsp;scientists, a&nbsp;meteorite the size of&nbsp;Mount Everest can destroy the entire planet. The disaster will happen in&nbsp;350&nbsp;days. There’s panic in&nbsp;the streets. People buy and build bunkers. Scientists and astronomers from all over the world were assembled to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;solution.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9ad/2b4/22051951b7be9add41542415e9.png><p>The only way to&nbsp;avoid the collision is&nbsp;to&nbsp;destroy the space object. Yeah, a&nbsp;powerful rocket can split an&nbsp;asteroid into hundreds of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;pieces. In&nbsp;this case, a&nbsp;meteor shower will hit the Earth, but it’s better than the complete destruction of&nbsp;our home. In&nbsp;less than a&nbsp;year, people build several powerful rockets.</p><p>Then, using the best telescopes in&nbsp;the world, astronomers create a&nbsp;unique guidance system. And now, we&nbsp;just have to&nbsp;wait for the asteroid to&nbsp;get into our solar system. All the people start moving to&nbsp;one continent with top-notch bunkers for everyone. The damage from the asteroid is&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;predict, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;better to&nbsp;hide people in&nbsp;one super large safe place to&nbsp;wait out the collision.</p><p>The moment has come. The asteroid passes by&nbsp;Uranus. The speed increases. Now the colossal space object moves only 10&nbsp;times slower than the speed of&nbsp;light. Scientists <a href=# title=launch data-link=tag>launch</a> rockets into the air. The asteroid flies past Saturn and destroys a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;its ring. The asteroid’s trajectory is&nbsp;changing.</p><p>It&nbsp;flies past other planets through a&nbsp;twisting path, picks up&nbsp;speed, and now heads towards the Earth. The rockets leave a&nbsp;long trail of&nbsp;fire behind and reach the speed of&nbsp;sound. They’re getting closer to&nbsp;the asteroid. Near Mars, a&nbsp;collision happens. The rockets hit the target. The asteroid explodes and splits into millions of&nbsp;particles. All the pieces fly in&nbsp;different directions. The Earth is&nbsp;saved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f99/4c4/11222456ed8e9ea40c526d20ff.png><p>At&nbsp;this moment, the Earth’s satellites record a&nbsp;huge burst of&nbsp;energy. A&nbsp;small part of&nbsp;the asteroid is&nbsp;heading towards Earth. It’s tiny, about the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;grain of&nbsp;sand. But the explosion accelerated&nbsp;it, and now the grain of&nbsp;sand is&nbsp;flying towards the Earth at&nbsp;a&nbsp;speed of&nbsp;185,000 miles per second, which is&nbsp;99% of&nbsp;the speed of&nbsp;light. [185,000 mps (~ 297,000&nbsp;kps)]<strong></strong></p><p>At&nbsp;this speed, the grain has almost the same destructive power that the entire asteroid had. It’s approaching the <a href=# title=Moon data-link=tag>Moon</a>, a&nbsp;few more seconds, and the grain of&nbsp;sand will hit our planet. All the people are waiting with bated breath. The grain gets such incredible power because of&nbsp;the laws of&nbsp;physics. The greater the speed any object&nbsp;is, the more mass and energy it&nbsp;has.</p><p>When the grain of&nbsp;sand reaches a&nbsp;speed close to&nbsp;the speed of&nbsp;light, its energy and mass begin to&nbsp;increase dramatically. You can’t even see this tiny grain of&nbsp;sand, but inside, it&nbsp;has the mass of&nbsp;an&nbsp;entire continent. If&nbsp;the grain reaches the speed of&nbsp;light, its mass will be&nbsp;infinite. And then, a&nbsp;<a href=# title="black hole" data-link=tag>black hole</a> will appear.</p><p>In&nbsp;this case, all living and even inanimate things on&nbsp;the planet will disappear. Trees, seas and oceans, all the cities, countries, and continents. Air, sound, atmosphere, any molecule of&nbsp;the Earth&nbsp;— everything will be&nbsp;absorbed by&nbsp;the incredible gravitational force of&nbsp;the black hole.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5cc/560/19081c5238a879aab210a245b8.png><p>Then, when there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;trace of&nbsp;our planet, the hole will take over the Moon. The gravitational force will grow and absorb other planets of&nbsp;the solar system. Soon, it&nbsp;will reach the <a href=# title=Sun data-link=tag>Sun</a>. Our star will split into thousands of&nbsp;strips like spaghetti and will emit a&nbsp;tremendous amount of&nbsp;energy.</p><p>This could trigger the birth of&nbsp;a&nbsp;second black hole, but ... fortunately, we&nbsp;only have&nbsp;99% of&nbsp;the speed of&nbsp;light, which changes everything. Also, no&nbsp;object that has mass can reach the speed of&nbsp;light. The grain of&nbsp;sand enters the Earth’s atmosphere. From the outside, it&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;blinding meteor that pierces the sky.</p><p>The grain heats&nbsp;up, passing through the layers of&nbsp;the atmosphere. Clouds within a&nbsp;radius of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hundred miles around are burning&nbsp;up. The sky becomes crystal clear. If&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;slow motion, you can see the air is&nbsp;ionized because the air molecules are split. In&nbsp;nature, this process occurs during lightning flashes. Our Sun also has ionizing energy and disinfects the air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/656/484/69cd3656d28d55f28361e9d09d.png><p>The meteorite leaves an&nbsp;ozone hole behind&nbsp;it. So&nbsp;now, this place is&nbsp;not protected from space radiation and ultraviolet light. The grain of&nbsp;sand flies straight into the center of&nbsp;the Southern Ocean. The closest continent to&nbsp;the explosion is&nbsp;<a href=# title=Antarctica data-link=tag>Antarctica</a>. The air around it&nbsp;warms up&nbsp;and mixes with the cold temperature of&nbsp;the ocean creating hurricanes.</p><p>As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the grain approaches the ocean surface, the water starts boiling. The temperature and energy of&nbsp;the grain are so&nbsp;huge that the water evaporates, but the vapor molecules are instantly burned&nbsp;up. Thousands of&nbsp;gallons of&nbsp;water just disappeared from the face of&nbsp;the Earth. The grain flies down for the first few feet without touching the surface as&nbsp;the water evaporates before&nbsp;it. Then it&nbsp;falls into the ocean and causes a&nbsp;powerful explosion.</p><p>Hundreds of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;gallons of&nbsp;water foam and boil because of&nbsp;the hot temperature. The entire ocean within a&nbsp;radius of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hundred miles is&nbsp;illuminated with a&nbsp;bright light. The ocean depths where sunbeams have never been before are almost as&nbsp;transparent as&nbsp;the water at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pool. The wreckage of&nbsp;old sunken ships splits into atoms because of&nbsp;the powerful explosion.</p><p>Unknown sea monsters and giant squids that live in&nbsp;the dark are afraid of&nbsp;the bright light and swim away. Then, finally, a&nbsp;grain of&nbsp;sand touches the seafloor and penetrates deep into the Earth’s crust. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;reaches the Earth’s core, the planet will most likely explode from a&nbsp;burst of&nbsp;incredible energy. Fortunately, this is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8be/ac7/586010573a97a96b6d74f38596.png><p>The resistance of&nbsp;the ocean and the ground slows down the grain and takes its energy away. It&nbsp;provokes a&nbsp;slight shift of&nbsp;tectonic plates. And there’s more to&nbsp;come. Huge waves form and spread throughout the ocean. The blast wave creates enormous tsunamis. Imagine throwing a&nbsp;small rock into a&nbsp;puddle.</p><p>The same thing happens to&nbsp;the ocean. Huge waves are approaching the coastal cities. Fortunately, people were evacuated from there, but the damage caused by&nbsp;one grain of&nbsp;sand will cost hundreds of&nbsp;trillions of&nbsp;dollars. Houses are destroyed, roads are flooded. After a&nbsp;while, it&nbsp;starts raining with hurricanes.</p><p>Ocean water vaporized by&nbsp;the grain forms into huge storm clouds. The wind drives them to&nbsp;the continents. And then, after the tsunami, prolonged rain begins, flooding entire countries. Several days later, natural disasters are still here.</p><p>The temperature of&nbsp;the Southern Ocean has increased by&nbsp;several degrees. The water is&nbsp;boiling at&nbsp;the collision site, melting the Antarctica glaciers. Millions of&nbsp;icebergs are melting away, so&nbsp;the water level of&nbsp;the world’s oceans is&nbsp;rising. The edges of&nbsp;some continents go&nbsp;underwater forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/abc/d09/b30bb05964ac1d338b30129d31.png><p>Thunderclouds reach the Sahara and other deserts. The shift of&nbsp;tectonic plates causes earthquakes on&nbsp;some continents. Volcanoes are awakening. The sky is&nbsp;filled with volcanic ash. It&nbsp;will take months for all the ashes to&nbsp;settle.</p><p>In&nbsp;the beginning, it&nbsp;creates challenging conditions for life on&nbsp;Earth. Plants and all living things don’t receive enough sunlight. In&nbsp;trees and seaweed, photosynthesis is&nbsp;disrupted. Oxygen production stops. It’s getting harder to&nbsp;breathe. The air that has filled the planet’s atmosphere is&nbsp;slowly running out.</p><p>People have to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;new conditions. They build new cities both on&nbsp;the land and in&nbsp;the ocean. They create plantations with artificial lighting for photosynthesis production. Fortunately, all the problems end when the ash settles. Inside the volcanoes, there’s hot magma flowing; it&nbsp;may come in&nbsp;handy as&nbsp;it’s rich in&nbsp;chemical elements and minerals.</p><p>Together with the ash, nutrients fall to&nbsp;the ground and the soil is&nbsp;now well fertilized. Plants, trees, fruits, and vegetables grow incredibly fast and produce a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;new oxygen. The Sahara is&nbsp;filled with blooming flowers now, and it&nbsp;looks more like a&nbsp;meadow with flowers, not a&nbsp;desert. The grain of&nbsp;sand just renewed the planet, instead of&nbsp;destroying&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a4d/006/7f97d156b4a5b98eee6115a0ce.png><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmoJ9lkWK0s63Ip2Sonl2orq%2BwjKGgratdqbWmecSaqa2gXZbBboWYZquhnV2ovaaxw2amn2WcnrSpwIxxaG1oaWZ8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
