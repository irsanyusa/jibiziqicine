We are taking this allegation seriously and would like to share the steps we are taking in response. Below are a few words from Mike.I'm, of course, aware of the allegation made about me from almost ten years ago, and I cannot begin to describe how difficult and disturbing this entire situation has been for everyone involved. I do not take this allegation lightly and would never downplay it. I have empathy for any human being who has experienced abuse or mistreatment in their lives, and I am inspired to see so many come forward and speak out about it. No one should have to suffer in silence, and I am thankful that the world is finally starting to listen. I also want to assure you that I have never intentionally manipulated or abused anyone in my life. That is not the person I am, how I was raised, or the type of behavior that I condone. I strongly believe in the empowerment of abuse victims, so if I have ever made anyone feel like they are less than equal, I am sincerely sorry.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5894bd82210556ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Paul Klein's biography: age, allegations, girlfriend, LANY</span></p></a>I love playing music more than anything on earth, and I am constantly humbled by the support of our fans. I do not want the allegation surrounding me to negatively affect the reputation or future of the band or to break the bond and trust that we have created with our fans over the years. So, I have decided to take a break and step away from my position in the band in hopes that this will allow my bandmates and fans to continue focusing on the music and message that Pierce The Veil stands for.<p class=align-left><i>Pierce the Veil </i>Mike Fuentes left the band in 2017 after the allegations against him became public.</p><h2>Is Mike back in Pierce the Veil?</h2><p class=align-left>Despite his appearance in a live stream by the band in April 2020, Mike Fuentes Pierce the Veil exist was reconfirmed by his brother, Vic in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a comment on Instagram</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5fd38951d6049817.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brian Quinn bio: Top facts about the Impractical Jokers star</span></p></a>Actually no Mike left the band back in 2017, but we're currently working on a new album and hoping to start touring again next year!<h2>Mike Fuentes tattoos</h2><p class=align-left>70% of the drummer's body is covered in different tattoos, but one of the most prominent are his Harry Potter tattoos.
