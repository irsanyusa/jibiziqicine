Perry recently wrapped up her residency in Las Vegas looking to be a full-time mom to her two-year-old daughter.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-katy-perry-getting-ready-for-retirement>Is Katy Perry Getting Ready For Retirement?</h2><p>Balancing duties like being a mom to her two-year-old daughter Daisy with her Las Vegas residency has proved to be difficult. Perry expressed her desire to give full attention to her daughter as she wraps up her residency in Las Vegas.</p><p>She initially did a residency because it allowed her to be more “artistic,” in her career while also enjoying the energy that comes along with it. Perry fans can rest assured knowing that Perry is not heading towards retirement while being on the top of her game.</p><p>“I really wanted to be able to strike more of a balance. To have a child and take her to preschool, but also be artistic and play with that energy.” Perry said, clarifying that she’s managing her time effectively to balance work with family.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a> judge is at the top of her music career today and is in a committed relationship with her fiancé Orlando Bloom.</p><p>“Orlando and I just did a hike with our daughter,” she said. “We went to look at some ducks and turtles because it’s so important for me to have those moments every single day.”</p><p>She shared how important family moments are for her and focusing on being a mom, also hinting at a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">world tour</a> after having family time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Wants To Be a Guest Judge on RuPaul’s Drag Race</h2><p>Putting rumors of her retirement to a complete end, Perry spoke about wanting to join&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RuPaul’s Drag Race</a>&nbsp;as a guest judge. With her songs being featured on the show’s iconic lip-syncs, Perry now wants to personally give the queens her thoughts.</p><p>“I’m definitely going to do it in the future, I hope.” She said talking about wanting to be part of the judge’s panel. The main challenge that has prevented her from being on the show yet is the timing. Perry revealed that they have tried multiple times to be on RuPaul’s Drag Race, but the timing never worked out.</p><p>According to the singer, she shows love for the show because she learned most of her on-stage skills from drag queens. Showing support for the drag queens, Perry brought up season ten winner Aquaria on stage during her Vegas residency.</p><p>Aquaria proceeded to teach Perry how to do the dip on stage, amusing the audience. The singer was overjoyed to have Aquaria on stage and thanked the drag queen for the “wild,” experience.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_DerekHough_HayleyErbert_Steve-GranitzFilmMagic.jpg alt="Derek Hough, Hayley Erbert to Perform Special Dance at Their Wedding" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ypqrsmWgmr%2BzxYytmKWjo2Kuo7vUrWSmp6SdsrO0zqibZpmWqbKzedarmKmomaO0bsHPZq2en5GoerOx0qKbnqaTrnqqv4ysn55loprBqr7Ip55o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
