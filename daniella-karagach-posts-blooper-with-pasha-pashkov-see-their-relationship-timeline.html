Recently, Karagach shared a funny blooper from their rehearsal for the DWTS tour, as the couple celebrates 13 years dancing together.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daniella-karagach-shares-blooper-with-husband-pasha-pashkov>Daniella Karagach Shares Blooper with Husband Pasha Pashkov</h2><p>In the clip posted to Karagach’s Instagram, the couple dances a sexy routine to “Crazy in Love” by Beyoncé. At one point, Pashkov runs toward Karagach and grabs her. The two of them end up falling over on the floor.</p><p>In her caption, Karagach posted plenty of cry-laughing emojis, calling it her “favorite blooper of all time” and adding in a hashtag that her “left butt cheek was purple.” Pashkov commented on the clip, writing, “I love how the lyrics right before that say ‘you got me, you got me.'”</p><p>Earlier this week, Karagach shared another <a href=#>Instagram post</a> celebrating the 13th anniversary of her and Pashkov becoming dance partners, writing, “You are my person&nbsp;@pashapashkov&nbsp;and I couldn’t imagine sharing our laughs, tears, victories, losses, spontaneous adventures, griefs, competitions, and experiences with anyone else on this planet.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CYSN7oCp9jT/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>MEET DANIELLA KARAGACH, THE LATEST ‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’ PRO SUPERSTAR</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-s-relationship-timeline>The Couple’s Relationship Timeline</h3><p>The couple first started dancing together in 2009, when Karagach was in her teens and Pashkov was in his 20s. “My coaches warned me that because I was so young and he was a top dancer in the finals already, people might not respect us as a compatible pair,” Karagach <a href=#>has said</a> of their team-up.</p><p>The partnership worked out, as the pair competed in dance competitions around the world and even won at the Blackpool Dance Festival in 2017. They also became a couple, tying the knot in 2014. In 2018, they appeared together on Season 2 of World of Dance before joining Dancing with the Stars in 2019.</p><p>“It is funny, because my mom, just before [we tried out together], was asking: ‘What if you start liking him. What if you start having feelings for him?'” Karagach recalled, according to <a href=#>Distractify</a>. “And I was like, ‘No way, he is so old! It’s never going to happen.'”</p><p>The couple told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> that they want to have kids eventually, but they’re focused on their careers for now. “I want a baby so bad,” Karagach shared. “But for now, our bodies are our tools. This is our priority.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1327056429.jpg alt="Miley Cyrus Needs to Release Her New Song From ‘Miley’s New Year’s Eve’ Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qlop2coa5ut8CrmKCZk516sbvSrapmmpykvLGx0WauoqyYYr2iv8eaZKmZo524sMKMrJyeZaSdsqq%2BjKucpZmknryvv8eip2asmaKyrbXNnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
