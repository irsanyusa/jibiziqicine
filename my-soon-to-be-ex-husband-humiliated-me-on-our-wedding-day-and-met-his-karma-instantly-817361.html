And we&nbsp;all hope that everything goes by&nbsp;our plan. But one bride was literally brought to&nbsp;tears by&nbsp;her partner right on&nbsp;their special day. And before that, she even begged him not to&nbsp;pull any cruel pranks on&nbsp;her. The angry woman was distraught by&nbsp;what her beloved man thought was very funny&nbsp;— and is&nbsp;now getting <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a> 48&nbsp;hours after their wedding.</p><p><h2>The first red flag showed up&nbsp;months before the wedding.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f7/285/ab423d5c84a810a4a4292c7cc6.jpg><p>One woman, who went under the nickname <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Constant-Nebula-1982</a>, has come to&nbsp;a&nbsp;social network to&nbsp;reveal her heartbreak as&nbsp;her husband totally embarrassed her on&nbsp;their special<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong> </strong></a>day. She also shared how he&nbsp;got his instant karma for doing this to&nbsp;her.</p><p>She began her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a> saying that she was writing the post two days since her wedding day. The woman had already been with her husband for 4&nbsp;years. One year of&nbsp;which they were engaged.</p><p>It&nbsp;all started a&nbsp;few months earlier when she noticed her husband Jake watching prank videos. Among other things, these videos showed embarrassing photos of&nbsp;the bride being played on&nbsp;a&nbsp;projector in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the whole room, or&nbsp;the bride’s face being smashed into the cake. She wrote, “I&nbsp;told him straight away that&nbsp;I didn’t want anything like that at&nbsp;our wedding. He&nbsp;just laughed and said that he&nbsp;wasn’t planning anything like that.”</p><p>Jake just laughed and said that he&nbsp;wasn’t planning anything like that. The woman thought that was the end of&nbsp;it, but she kept catching him making strange arrangements with his friends. He&nbsp;suddenly wanted to&nbsp;choose the wedding photographer and the cake.</p><p><h2>On&nbsp;the wedding day, the woman felt the biggest emotional pain in&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/055/0f8/14cec55b87a2b74a5a9b9b20d1.jpg><p>The woman highlighted that she was so&nbsp;concerned about the smoothness of&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>special</a> day, that she decided to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;her husband-to-be one more time. She reminded him the day before that if&nbsp;he&nbsp;did something like that, she would <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>break up</a>&nbsp;with him immediately.</p><p>When the day of&nbsp;the wedding came, everything went smoothly until the ceremony. Until the moment came when the cake was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cut. The whole room watched as&nbsp;the bride made the first cut and the photographer stood in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the couple with camera in&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman felt a&nbsp;hand on&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;her head, pushing her face-first into the cake. Not only her make-up but the whole wedding dress was ruined, and the whole room laughed, her husband the loudest.</p><p><h2>The revenge for his bad deed came to&nbsp;the man immediately.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/345/8a2/aadc605f968327c4029e69e76f.jpg><p>The woman recalls how, at&nbsp;the most embarrassing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moment</a> of&nbsp;her life, the photographer took the photo and Jake said that this was now their wedding photo. She <a href=# title=turned data-link=tag>turned</a> around, slapped him in&nbsp;the face and ran out of&nbsp;the room in&nbsp;tears.</p><p>The karma didn’t take long to&nbsp;arrive and came in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;his own <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brother</a>. The woman described how she ran to&nbsp;the toilet and started crying when she suddenly heard loud shouting from the hall. It&nbsp;was her husband’s brother Frank. She could barely understand what he&nbsp;was saying, and when she left the toilet he&nbsp;was waiting for her.</p><p>Frank told her that Jake had something to&nbsp;tell her. Jake was shaking and apologized without looking his wife in&nbsp;the eye. Frank told him to&nbsp;look her in&nbsp;the eye and apologize again. Even the woman herself was a&nbsp;bit scared of&nbsp;Frank at&nbsp;that moment, because she had always thought of&nbsp;him as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind and gentle man. She confessed that she had never seen him angry before.</p><p><h2>The woman’s final decision about her marriage was tough but justified.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/258/9f9/742ef657979219d08e767c5a7c.jpg><p>The woman continues her <a href=# title=story data-link=tag>story</a>, saying that she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> Frank if&nbsp;he&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;an&nbsp;exaggeration if&nbsp;she separated from her husband, and he&nbsp;said&nbsp;no, because according to&nbsp;him, she deserved better, and he&nbsp;didn’t care how his brother felt about it&nbsp;because he&nbsp;had brought it&nbsp;on&nbsp;himself. Then he&nbsp;told her that if&nbsp;she needed help collecting her things, he&nbsp;would help her and gave her his number.</p><p>The woman finally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;separate from Jake and file for divorce and informed him and her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> about&nbsp;it. Jake just told her not to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that because it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;harmless prank. The woman writes that she was spammed by&nbsp;both his family and hers that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;ridiculous to&nbsp;end their <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> over this. But she sees it&nbsp;differently.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “If&nbsp;he&nbsp;does something like this to&nbsp;me&nbsp;despite multiple requests not to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;even after promising he&nbsp;wouldn’t do&nbsp;it, then&nbsp;I can’t trust him. No&nbsp;matter what he&nbsp;promises&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;assume that the opposite can and will happen. And that he&nbsp;doesn’t care at&nbsp;all how&nbsp;I feel about his decisions. This situation can be&nbsp;projected onto so&nbsp;many much worse situations where it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;important for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;trust him.”</p><p>His brother Frank seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the only one who supports her now<strong>,</strong> and she will go&nbsp;through with the divorce. She concludes her post, writing, “<strong>Call me&nbsp;humorless, call me&nbsp;what you want, but&nbsp;I have given my&nbsp;reasons.”</strong></p><p>And here’s yet another story about a&nbsp;woman who was <a href=#>betrayed</a> by&nbsp;her beloved, but years later, she rose like a&nbsp;phoenix from the ashes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edKopqdlpKR6o7GMnq9moKWor6K6w2afrqWZobaiwMSdZKadXaS7brvUq2SwnZSZtq%2BzjJ2YsmWRo7FuucStZKGho2K4or7MmmSipqOprq%2FAy7JkcWlnaINyew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
