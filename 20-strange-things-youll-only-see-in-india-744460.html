India has so&nbsp;much to&nbsp;offer, and here are facts to&nbsp;support&nbsp;it.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;prove to&nbsp;you that India still hides secrets you didn’t know about.</p><p><h2>1. The third sex, the Hijras</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9eb/c86/7fec1258de908905a0df35e9a9.jpg><p>In&nbsp;India, the term <a href=#>Hijra</a> is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;those people who consider themselves transgender or&nbsp;transsexual. Hijras have a&nbsp;history recorded on&nbsp;the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, as&nbsp;suggested also by&nbsp;the Kāma Sūtra. In&nbsp;April 2014, India’s Supreme Court recognized transgender people as&nbsp;a ’third sex’ in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special law also regarding passports and other official documents.</p><p><h2>2. A&nbsp;pilgrimage of&nbsp;130 million people</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>Kumbh Mela</a>, a&nbsp;Hindu pilgrimage that is&nbsp;repeated every 12&nbsp;years, is&nbsp;the largest human gathering in&nbsp;the world, and it’s also visible from <a href=# title=space data-link=tag>space</a>. This year the Kumbh Mela was held in&nbsp;Ardh of&nbsp;Allahabad from January 15th to&nbsp;March 4th 2019 and is&nbsp;estimated to&nbsp;have seen the participation of&nbsp;130 million people.</p><p><h2>3. The first plastic surgery book</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/790/eaf/dbff26572ab8df899650b05148.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Sushruta Samhita</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;ancient Sanskrit text of&nbsp;<a href=# title=medicine data-link=tag>medicine</a> that is&nbsp;considered among the first and foremost texts concerning the detailed study of&nbsp;medicine and <a href=# title=surgery data-link=tag>surgery</a>. Written by&nbsp;Sushruta, it&nbsp;has been dated around the sixth century BC. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;from this text that modern plastic surgery seems to&nbsp;have originated. The text describes the reconstruction of&nbsp;the lips (labioplasty) and the nose (rhinoplasty), using a&nbsp;flap of&nbsp;skin on&nbsp;the cheeks.</p><p><h2>4. Bull surfing</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4d9/a50/793f9a50aaa9a8842b20d6c88a.jpg><p><a href=#>Bull surfing</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;harvest sport race that takes place in&nbsp;the village of&nbsp;Anandapally, in&nbsp;southern Kerala, during the post-harvest season. A&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;yoked bulls are used to&nbsp;plow a&nbsp;rice field the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;football field, in&nbsp;water that is&nbsp;ankle-deep, while their handlers surf a&nbsp;wooden plank and hang on&nbsp;to&nbsp;the bulls’ tails or&nbsp;onto their harnesses.</p><p><h2>5. Unusual post offices</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;India, post offices can be&nbsp;really different than the ones we&nbsp;are used&nbsp;to. Like a&nbsp;<a href=#>floating post office</a> built in&nbsp;a&nbsp;carved houseboat or&nbsp;the <a href=#>world’s highest post office</a> at&nbsp;15,500&nbsp;ft above sea level in&nbsp;Himachal Pradesh. In&nbsp;the 1970s, some cities in&nbsp;Rajasthan even had mobile camel post offices, while mules were used in&nbsp;the Darjeeling mountain areas of&nbsp;Bengal.</p><p><h2>6. Unique endangered animal species</h2></p><p>India hosts some of&nbsp;the rarest and most particular species that can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;Asia. Among these we&nbsp;have the endangered <a href=#>Asiatic lion</a> and the unique <a href=#>purple frog</a>.</p><p><h2>7. The largest consumption of&nbsp;gold per year</h2></p><p>India is&nbsp;among the largest consumers of&nbsp;gold in&nbsp;the world. Indian demand has averaged 838 tons per year over the last 10&nbsp;years. In&nbsp;2018, <a href=#>760.4 tons</a> of&nbsp;gold were consumed, most of&nbsp;which were used for jewelry making for marriages and festivals.</p><p><h2>8. Bridges made entirely with roots</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>bridges in&nbsp;the state of&nbsp;Meghalaya</a>, the wettest in&nbsp;the world, are made entirely with roots to&nbsp;prevent them from rotting due to&nbsp;moisture. The process of&nbsp;creating bridges takes years to&nbsp;complete, but bridges built in&nbsp;this way are much more resistant than those made of&nbsp;wood.</p><p>The <a href=#>Padmanabhaswamy Temple</a>, in&nbsp;the capital of&nbsp;Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, is&nbsp;not only the richest Hindu temple in&nbsp;the world, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;also the richest place of&nbsp;worship to&nbsp;ever exist. In&nbsp;2011, the archeology department opened the secret compartments of&nbsp;the temple to&nbsp;inspect the items stored inside and found objects of&nbsp;gold, silver, and precious stones worth hundreds of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;dollars.</p><p><h2>9. 16&nbsp;adornments of&nbsp;a&nbsp;married woman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b46/29d/6531dc572d989b85c50078a617.jpg><p>Only after getting married do&nbsp;women use their 16&nbsp;adornments, called <a href=#>Sola Shringar</a>. Among these are the Bindi, the colored dot placed on&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the forehead and the Nath, or&nbsp;nose piercing.</p><p><h2>10. A&nbsp;fast for 80&nbsp;years</h2></p><p><a href=#>Prahlad Jani</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;Indian breatharian monk who claims to&nbsp;have lived without food and water since 1940. He&nbsp;says that the goddess Amba sustains him. 2&nbsp;observational studies of&nbsp;Jani have been conducted, one in&nbsp;2003 and one in&nbsp;2010. In&nbsp;both cases the investigators confirmed Jani’s ability to&nbsp;survive healthily without food and water during the testing periods, although neither study was submitted to&nbsp;a&nbsp;scientific journal.</p><p><h2>11. The tallest statue in&nbsp;the world</h2></p><p>India holds the record for possessing the world’s largest statue that stands at&nbsp;a&nbsp;height of&nbsp;182&nbsp;m and is&nbsp;known as&nbsp;the “<a href=#>statue of&nbsp;unity</a>.” The statue represents the Indian independence movement leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, popularly known as&nbsp;Sardar Patel.</p><p><h2>12. The color of&nbsp;mourning is&nbsp;not black</h2></p><p><h2>13. Magnetic hill of&nbsp;Ladakh</h2></p><p><a href=#>Magnet Hill</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;“Cyclops hill” located near Leh in&nbsp;Ladakh, India. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact, the notorious hill has caused planes from the Indian Air Force to&nbsp;divert their route in&nbsp;the past to&nbsp;avoid magnetic interference. Objects and cars on&nbsp;the hill may appear to&nbsp;roll uphill, in&nbsp;defiance of&nbsp;gravity, when they are in&nbsp;fact, rolling downhill since the hill road is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;downhill road.</p><p><h2>14. The 9&nbsp;unknown men</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36c/42c/b7116e50c88ccb47925c71f097.jpg><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>9 Unknown Men</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret society founded by&nbsp;the Mauryan Emperor, Ashoka, around 270&nbsp;BC to&nbsp;preserve and develop knowledge that would be&nbsp;dangerous to&nbsp;humanity if&nbsp;it&nbsp;fell into the wrong hands. Each of&nbsp;the 9&nbsp;is supposedly responsible for guarding and improving a&nbsp;single book. Each book deals with a&nbsp;different branch of&nbsp;potentially hazardous knowledge.</p><p><h2>15. The largest film industry in&nbsp;the world</h2></p><p><a href=#>Bollywood</a>, is&nbsp;the Indian Hindi-language film industry based in&nbsp;Mumbai and it&nbsp;produced <a href=#>1,813 films</a> in&nbsp;2018&nbsp;alone. By&nbsp;2012&nbsp;it had far surpassed those produced by&nbsp;Hollywood. The term “Bollywood” derives from the merger of&nbsp;2&nbsp;other famous names, Bombay and Hollywood.</p><p><h2>16. Tower of&nbsp;Silence</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;the Zoroastrian religion Earth and Fire are both considered sacred. For this reason, they built the Dakhma, also called the <a href=#>Tower of&nbsp;Silence</a>. The Tower of&nbsp;Silence is&nbsp;a&nbsp;circular, raised structure built for excarnation, that&nbsp;is, for dead bodies to&nbsp;be&nbsp;exposed to&nbsp;carrion birds, usually vultures. Although present in&nbsp;Iran, the Towers of&nbsp;Silence are currently only used in&nbsp;India.</p><p><h2>17. Men holding hands in&nbsp;public</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;India it&nbsp;is&nbsp;common to&nbsp;see men holding hands in&nbsp;the streets. In&nbsp;some countries this might be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular sexual orientation, but in&nbsp;India it&nbsp;is&nbsp;only a&nbsp;demonstration of&nbsp;affection between 2&nbsp;true friends. On&nbsp;that same note, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;really rare to&nbsp;see signs of&nbsp;affection between a&nbsp;man and a&nbsp;woman. It’s frowned upon for them to&nbsp;kiss in&nbsp;public.</p><p><h2>18. Wedding rings on&nbsp;the feet</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5bd/23e/fbd27059819caf96d3bda252f9.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Tamil Nadu, the <a href=#>wedding ring</a> is&nbsp;placed on&nbsp;the “index” toe of&nbsp;the foot. The 2&nbsp;silver rings, placed by&nbsp;the groom on&nbsp;the feet of&nbsp;his beloved, would be&nbsp;able, according to&nbsp;tradition, to&nbsp;inspire a&nbsp;healthy pregnancy. Gold rings have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;avoided in&nbsp;this instance, since gold for Hindus is&nbsp;the symbol of&nbsp;the goddess of&nbsp;abundance: Lakshmi. Putting it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the feet, which are considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most humble part of&nbsp;the body, could be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;outrageous.</p><p>Have you ever traveled to&nbsp;India?
