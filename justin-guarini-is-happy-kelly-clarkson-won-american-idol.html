The singer has since revealed that it was obvious Clarkson deserved to win the competition. In present day, Guarini continues to support Clarkson’s endeavors.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Justin Guarini Thought He Would Need Extra Security if He Won American Idol</h2><p>There were two singers left standing at the end of American Idol‘s inaugural season, Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson. Although America loved each singer, only one could be crowned as the winner. In honor of the show’s 20th anniversary, Guarini revealed that he knew he’d lose to Clarkson.</p><p>In a recent interview, the American Idol runner up explained that he felt fans would have been upset if he beat Clarkson. He recalls hearing “A Moment Like This” off-stage while alongside show executive producer, Nigel Lythgoe. While Clarkson was singing, Guarini told Lythgoe that the show would have to hire extra security if he won.</p><p>“I was like, ‘If I win this thing, there’s going to be a riot,'” he <a href=#>said</a>. “Because it was so apparent to any objective observer that Kelly was the one to win.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/nZQFXYPNx8E</p></figure><p>Even though Guarani placed in second, there were never any hard feelings toward Clarkson. Since they had grown close, he explained that he was “genuinely joyful” to hear her name. To this day, he believes she deserved to win.</p><p>Guarini and Clarkson remain as friends in present day. The runner up was last seen with Clarkson on her talk show (in 2019). While on the series, the pair talked about American Idol and their music comedy From Justin to Kelly.</p><p>“I will always be one of her biggest fans because I was there from the beginning and got to see her progression,” Guarini said.</p><p>He also complimented his co stars ability to connect with her fans and remain authentically herself throughout her very public career/talk show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-he-been-up-to-since-american-idol>What Has He Been up to Since American Idol?</h2><p>Since placing second in American Idol, Guarini has released two studio albums, and an acoustic EP. In 2010, he made his Broadway debut as Carlos in the musical adaptation of Pedro Almodovar’s film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. HE later appeared in the modern Broadway production of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, Wicked, Rent, Chicago, Company, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.</p><p>Besides music, he’s an actor. Guarini stars in Fast Girl, The Unknown: Frankie The Squirrel, Mafioso II: The Son, and Tilt-a-whirl. Since 2015, Guarini has grace televisions as <a href=#>Lil’ Sweet</a> in Diet Dr. Pepper commercials. A year after beginning the joke, Dr Pepper “promoted” tunes for a Lil’ Sweet album with video clips and promotional photos of the character. Later, he dropped the exclusive 17 track EP via PledgeMusic.</p><p>In current day, Guarini teaches a Broadway audition masterclass. The master class features a step-by-step tutorial on how to ace your special audition. The program emphasizes that the student will learn confidence, how to tilt a decision in their favor, how to create authentic relationships, how to have the “X Factor,” and how to get rid of nervous energy.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1384376770.jpg alt="James Arthur’s Journey from ‘The X Factor’ to Mainstream Music" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>justin guarini</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ya6qraGeYrS2rdGipaJlmah6qa3PqbBmo5Whubp5wqWYq6OjpLtuw86nZJqllae2pK3NZqCdp5xk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
