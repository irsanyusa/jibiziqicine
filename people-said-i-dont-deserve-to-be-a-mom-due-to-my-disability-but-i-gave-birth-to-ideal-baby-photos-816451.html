But that’s what happened to&nbsp;Courtney from Idaho. She and her husband just had a&nbsp;lovely <a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a> girl, and now she’s sharing how she dealt with unkind comments.</p><p><h2>Love knows no&nbsp;boundaries, and Courtney Blackmore and her husband proved&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/781/254/be92865916b85512b9be5bc6b5.jpeg><p>Many couples all over the world really look forward to&nbsp;having a&nbsp;baby and becoming parents. They’re excited about taking care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;little baby, seeing their first smiles, and feeling the special <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> that parents have.</p><p>Just like any other couple, Courtney and Rayden Blackmore had the same dreams of&nbsp;becoming mom and dad and having a&nbsp;child. They also really wanted to&nbsp;feel the incredible happiness that comes with being parents. But, their journey had some challenges along the way.</p><p><h2>They didn’t realize that some people wouldn’t support their choice to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c6a/4d8/9a7f5052679ced588f73ac6a5b.jpeg><p>But, despite the difficulties, Courtney and Rayden’s strong love for each other and their determination helped them make their dreams come true. Courtney had to&nbsp;deal with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;tough stuff in&nbsp;her life, especially because she was born with a&nbsp;condition called cystic hygroma that made a&nbsp;sac-like thing on&nbsp;her face. People made fun of&nbsp;her because of&nbsp;it, but she stayed strong. Then, in&nbsp;2021, something surprising happened&nbsp;— she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> love while playing “Call of&nbsp;Duty.”</p><p>Courtney didn’t realize that Rayden, the person she met online, would turn out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the person she loved the most. After talking online, they decided to&nbsp;meet in&nbsp;real life, and that marked the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;new part of&nbsp;their lives. They made a&nbsp;home for themselves in&nbsp;Idaho and started working on&nbsp;their dreams. One of&nbsp;the things they both wanted was to&nbsp;become parents, and they couldn’t wait for the day when they could start a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.</p><p><h2>She decided to&nbsp;think about the good things in&nbsp;her life and ignored the mean comments from others.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c3a/ed8/3d047d54c69bb6b5ef124a656c.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;March 2023, this happy couple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> the news of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> with the world by&nbsp;posting about it&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, where Courtney had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;followers. While she was pregnant, Courtney kept a&nbsp;record of&nbsp;her journey, regularly sharing updates, photos, and videos of&nbsp;their growing family.</p><p>Among all the kind comments, some people said mean things. They questioned whether she should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom and even said hurtful things about her daughter. Courtney talked about how she faced this negativity, and she said it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong but vulnerable voice, showing both her strength and sensitivity.</p><p>Despite these hurtful and ignorant comments, Courtney made a&nbsp;choice to&nbsp;ignore the negativity because she realized it&nbsp;wasn’t worth her time and energy. She decided to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;the good things in&nbsp;her life and didn’t pay attention to&nbsp;the mean remarks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/fae/92b/3b248459539623cf62df0fd75b.jpeg><p>Sometimes, Courtney felt like she needed to&nbsp;speak up&nbsp;when people were saying ignorant things. She told them that their comments, which were based on&nbsp;ignorance and discrimination, were not okay. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her TikTok videos, she showed a&nbsp;comment that said, “Some people shouldn’t be&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;have kids.” She replied with strength, saying, <strong>“Keep in&nbsp;mind I&nbsp;do not carry my&nbsp;own birth defect. It’s not genetic for&nbsp;me.”</strong></p><p>On&nbsp;September&nbsp;30, the Blackmore couple happily welcomed their <strong>healthy baby girl, Seraphina Rose Kay,</strong> into the world. The proud mom <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> this heartwarming news on&nbsp;her social media, posting lovely pictures of&nbsp;her and her husband holding their new baby daughter.</p><p>The online community showed them a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;love and support. They gave the little girl a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;compliments and called her “perfect.” Many people congratulated the Blackmores from the bottom of&nbsp;their hearts, saying they were really lucky parents.</p><p><h2>Courtney also talked about how some people were worried that her child might inherit her birth defect.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/59f/faf/c7ae795103812c2efb80358130.jpeg><p>She explained that she had already done genetic testing, which showed that she wasn’t a&nbsp;carrier of&nbsp;the condition. She made it&nbsp;clear that they knew she couldn’t pass on&nbsp;her birth defect, so&nbsp;she wasn’t worried.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e50/e1e/b53c6a5fa4ba8f90fd43a3772d.jpeg><p>No&nbsp;matter what happened, Courtney never wavered in&nbsp;her love for her daughter. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, <strong>“Even if&nbsp;my&nbsp;child had a&nbsp;disability, I&nbsp;would love my&nbsp;child no&nbsp;matter what.”</strong> She strongly asked people not to&nbsp;judge disabled individuals who want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;parents, pointing out that genetic factors shouldn’t limit love and care.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e3f/880/2eb7135c9fb8b24b914b36c1fb.jpeg><p>Courtney’s words echoed the unwavering love parents have for their children, no&nbsp;matter the challenges they face. Her message underlined the enduring commitment that parents hold, emphasizing that their love remains steadfast and unconditional, regardless of&nbsp;their children’s circumstances. It&nbsp;showcased the strength of&nbsp;parental love, continuously supporting and nurturing children as&nbsp;they navigate life’s challenges and thrive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/011/3ad/e3349550029486313db5df71c0.jpeg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL2mu8%2BlnGarkZ6xbrWMnaanrF2ZsrSx0a%2BcZqyfYq%2BmecBmpKilXZnCpnnTqGSmsV2ZtrStwaKjoqypYq%2B2wIyiZKCZppp6o7XRrZ9mrJ9itqWxwKVkm5mSrnqxtM6tpqxlaGaDdYGQaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
