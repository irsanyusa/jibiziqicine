Its existence was first theorized in&nbsp;1930, when the electron was discovered. Scientists thought it&nbsp;might mean the exact opposite should exist too, and they called this hypothetical particle “positron.” Later, antipodes of&nbsp;other elementary particles, protons and neutrons, were proven to&nbsp;exist as&nbsp;well.</p><p>When a&nbsp;particle and its evil twin collide with each other, they disappear, releasing literal tons of&nbsp;<a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a>&nbsp;— 10,000 times more than a&nbsp;nuclear reaction does. But there’s a&nbsp;catch: it&nbsp;takes about 100 billion years to&nbsp;create just 1&nbsp;g of&nbsp;anti-matter, and it&nbsp;can only be&nbsp;created using the Large Hadron Collider. That’s why the cost of&nbsp;this substance is&nbsp;about $62 trillion bucks. And we’re not even close to&nbsp;getting that much!</p><p>Throughout the entire history of&nbsp;space observation, only two objects from another star system, or&nbsp;maybe even another galaxy, have entered our Solar System. The first one was the Oumuamua asteroid, discovered in&nbsp;2017. The second was Borisov&nbsp;— a&nbsp;comet found in&nbsp;August 2019. The cloud of&nbsp;dust that surrounds it&nbsp;allows scientists to&nbsp;learn more about substances that may have come to&nbsp;us from another galaxy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/812/ea7/367ef458809001bd3ec07e9d3a.png><p>An&nbsp;unusual teardrop-shaped star was found. It&nbsp;has almost twice the mass of&nbsp;the Sun and looks like a&nbsp;big drop of&nbsp;lava because of&nbsp;the dwarf star hanging out nearby. The little buddy attracts the energy of&nbsp;its “big brother” and distorts its surface. Black holes can do&nbsp;that too: there’s a&nbsp;star about 215 million light years away from&nbsp;us that got ‘spaghettified’ because of&nbsp;the gravity of&nbsp;a&nbsp;black hole nearby.</p><p>Astronomers on&nbsp;Earth had to&nbsp;use dozens of&nbsp;telescopes to&nbsp;register the event. In&nbsp;the end, they saw a&nbsp;black hole gobbling up&nbsp;a&nbsp;star, which stretched until it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;thin ray of&nbsp;matter. As&nbsp;it&nbsp;was eating, the hole also ejected billions of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;star material into space.</p><p>About 250 million light years away, though, there’s a&nbsp;miraculous survival story: in&nbsp;2020, a&nbsp;red giant came too close to&nbsp;a&nbsp;massive black hole, 400,000 times heavier than the Sun, and got caught in&nbsp;its gravitational pull. Normally, this means there’s no&nbsp;escape: once a&nbsp;black hole catches something, it&nbsp;will never let go&nbsp;of&nbsp;its prey. In&nbsp;this case, the star somehow managed to&nbsp;get away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cbc/926/c3bd8a558aae256ff76476c866.png><p>Most of&nbsp;its outer layers were slurped away by&nbsp;the hungry black beast, leaving behind only the molten core&nbsp;— a&nbsp;white dwarf. And using this loss of&nbsp;mass, it&nbsp;ripped itself from the black hole’s tug and started circling it&nbsp;at&nbsp;an&nbsp;ever-increasing orbit. Scientists are sure the white dwarf is&nbsp;still imprisoned forever, though, because the hole continues to&nbsp;chip away at&nbsp;it&nbsp;even as&nbsp;it&nbsp;gets further.</p><p>In&nbsp;the end, the star will cool down and become a&nbsp;<a href=# title=planet data-link=tag>planet</a> that looks much like <a href=# title=Jupiter data-link=tag>Jupiter</a>&nbsp;— but that might only happen in&nbsp;about a&nbsp;trillion years, (I&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;around then), and much longer than the Universe has been around so&nbsp;far. It&nbsp;was proved that a&nbsp;planet can orbit a&nbsp;black hole as&nbsp;it&nbsp;would a&nbsp;star. The energy from the hole would feed such a&nbsp;planet.</p><p>But to&nbsp;survive in&nbsp;such conditions and not be&nbsp;pumped inside the event horizon, the planet must orbit very quickly, at&nbsp;nearly the speed of&nbsp;light, and the black hole itself must spin at&nbsp;the same speed. I&nbsp;can’t but imagine what kind of&nbsp;life it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;on&nbsp;such a&nbsp;planet... Fast?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/54c/c7d/ca5c3457358bac61f208fa65ab.png><p>Earthquakes on&nbsp;the Moon (or&nbsp;should&nbsp;I say “moonquakes”?) aren’t something from science-fiction. They don’t occur as&nbsp;often as&nbsp;on&nbsp;our planet. And when they&nbsp;do, it&nbsp;happens closer to&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the satellite. Scientists think “moonquakes” might be&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;the gravity of&nbsp;Earth and the Sun. There are marsquakes too!</p><p>For a&nbsp;long time, the red planet had been considered tectonically inactive, but more recent observations have shown it&nbsp;still has weak quakes from time to&nbsp;time. You probably wouldn’t even be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;feel them if&nbsp;you stood on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Mars data-link=tag>Mars</a>’ surface, but it&nbsp;means some geological processes are still going on&nbsp;underneath the red and dusty landscape.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/394/916/f8f0b9550dadca037a20e4f438.png><p>At&nbsp;a&nbsp;distance of&nbsp;640 light-years from the Sun, scientists discovered planet WASP-76&nbsp;b where it&nbsp;rains iron. The planet is&nbsp;very close to&nbsp;its sun and always turned to&nbsp;it&nbsp;with the same side&nbsp;— the term is&nbsp;“tidally locked”. The temperature on&nbsp;the “sunny” side is&nbsp;so&nbsp;high that metals melt and evaporate there. The other half of&nbsp;the planet is&nbsp;cool enough so&nbsp;that metals condense again and fall down as&nbsp;rain.</p><p>Speaking of&nbsp;tidal locks, our Moon is&nbsp;the same way: there’s no&nbsp;dark side to&nbsp;our satellite, it’s just always turned to&nbsp;us with one side. When the Moon happens to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in-between the Earth and the Sun, what we&nbsp;call its “dark side” becomes brightly lit&nbsp;— we&nbsp;just can’t see it&nbsp;from our planet. Figures.</p><p>Turns out there are plenty of&nbsp;planets in&nbsp;the Universe and even in&nbsp;the Milky Way galaxy that have liquid or&nbsp;frozen water on&nbsp;them. The closest one is&nbsp;within our Solar System&nbsp;— it’s Europa, one of&nbsp;Jupiter’s moons. Scientists are almost sure that, underneath its frozen surface, there’s an&nbsp;actual ocean of&nbsp;water. But it’s too soon to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hyped about possible life on&nbsp;such planets: liquid water is&nbsp;only one of&nbsp;many things that have to&nbsp;come together for life to&nbsp;appear on&nbsp;a&nbsp;planet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cde/d81/8a17135be684be247eba25d72e.png><p>In&nbsp;fact, there’s a&nbsp;place millions of&nbsp;light years away where there’s a&nbsp;whole floating space cloud made entirely of&nbsp;water. There’s so&nbsp;much of&nbsp;it&nbsp;that it&nbsp;could fill all our oceans 140 trillion times over. Slightly more than what we&nbsp;need. Water on&nbsp;Earth is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;puzzle shrouded in&nbsp;mystery and covered with riddles. The most popular theory is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;was brought to&nbsp;our planet by&nbsp;icy comets and asteroids that left behind not only mighty craters but the liquid substance thanks to&nbsp;which we&nbsp;can now thrive.</p><p>But in&nbsp;space, there’s a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;organic matter, and under specific conditions, it&nbsp;could yield so&nbsp;much water it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;fill our oceans a&nbsp;thousand times over. Researchers conducted an&nbsp;experiment in&nbsp;which they heated this organic matter and obtained clear water and <a href=# title=oil data-link=tag>oil</a>. If&nbsp;this is&nbsp;confirmed in&nbsp;future studies, it&nbsp;could mean that even oil appeared on&nbsp;Earth not only thanks to&nbsp;fossilized remains of&nbsp;living beings but came from outer space as&nbsp;well.</p><p>And yet, there just might be&nbsp;about 6&nbsp;billion Earth-like planets in&nbsp;the Milky Way galaxy alone. The latest data has shown that every fifth Sun-like star can have at&nbsp;least one planet in&nbsp;its habitable zone. And not just any planet, mind you: it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;rocky core and surface, and it’s of&nbsp;a&nbsp;comparable size to&nbsp;the Earth. Being inside the habitable zone of&nbsp;its star, such a&nbsp;planet would have high chances of&nbsp;becoming home to&nbsp;living creatures&nbsp;— microbes, at&nbsp;least.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/659/0ff/bb68d45248a111cd1780c94cbc.png><p>And if&nbsp;there are billions of&nbsp;these planets in&nbsp;our galaxy, you could safely say that at&nbsp;least one of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;not only inhabitable but inhabited already. And now multiply this by&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;galaxies in&nbsp;the Universe, also considering that many of&nbsp;them are much bigger than the Milky Way. This gives&nbsp;us billions upon billions of&nbsp;Sun-like stars and Earth-like planets, and some of&nbsp;them are surely more like ours than others.</p><p>Until recently, we&nbsp;thought our galaxy looked like a&nbsp;circular spiral. But recent research has shown it&nbsp;looks more like a&nbsp;Pringles chip. Scientists measured the distances between the Sun and other stars and created a&nbsp;three-dimensional map of&nbsp;the Milky Way based on&nbsp;this data. It&nbsp;turned out that our galaxy is&nbsp;slightly curved at&nbsp;the edges and takes an&nbsp;S shape.</p><p>And get this: we&nbsp;might be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;walk upright because of&nbsp;supernova explosions. About&nbsp;2.5 million years ago, a&nbsp;supernova sent cosmic rays to&nbsp;our planet. They triggered a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;electrical storms in&nbsp;the Earth’s atmosphere, which turned into thunderstorms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/60c/864/6a6a675985906c27e9611f0bba.png><p>Those, in&nbsp;their turn, caused wildfires in&nbsp;northeast Africa, where our earlier ancestors lived. Fires turned the forest area into a&nbsp;savanna, the atmospheric pressure changed, and our ancestors had to&nbsp;stand on&nbsp;two legs to&nbsp;survive.</p><p>The biggest explosion since the Big Bang was registered in&nbsp;2019. This happened in&nbsp;the Ophiuchus cluster, which unites thousands of&nbsp;galaxies. According to&nbsp;scientists, the blast was equal to&nbsp;20&nbsp;billion <i>billion</i> (that’s 18&nbsp;zeroes) megaton explosions happening once a&nbsp;millisecond for 240 million years. I’ll have to&nbsp;trust that. My&nbsp;math is&nbsp;not that good.</p><p>Remember the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs on&nbsp;Earth? Who could forget? There might’ve been another space show that ended badly for at&nbsp;least&nbsp;75% of&nbsp;all life on&nbsp;our planet in&nbsp;the past. Roughly 360 million years ago, a&nbsp;supernova explosion occurred about 65&nbsp;light years away from&nbsp;us, and the cosmic rays sent by&nbsp;it&nbsp;swept away the ozone layer of&nbsp;our pretty blue ball.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b71/da3/3c49405c29bae388865d4b4d89.png><p>If&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been any closer, all life could’ve easily been gone.</p><p>Right now, the greatest threat for&nbsp;us comes in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;Betelgeuse&nbsp;— not the movie, but a&nbsp;giant star about 600 light years away. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;explodes into a&nbsp;supernova, we’ll see it&nbsp;with unaided eyes even during the day.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqwv9NmnLGolaPAqsLEZquhoZ6cerC6jJ6Yq6yYYsGit8SsZJuhnKG2sLrSZqafZamarrO%2FjK2mZqWRoLJuhJBsb2xsXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
