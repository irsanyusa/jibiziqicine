Relationships between humans and their pets are special, and dogs can hold an especially tight grip on the heart.&nbsp;</p><p>Before you decide to welcome a dog into your life, though, it’s best to be prepared. This is doubly true if you’re a newcomer to a country like Germany, where you’ll find strict rules governing dog adoption. Whether you’ve lived in Germany for a long time or have just moved from abroad, you may be wondering just how difficult it is to adopt a dog in Germany.&nbsp;</p><p>To help you along, this guide will take you through the entire process of dog adoption in Germany — from research to registration.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-prepare-for-a-dog-adoption-in-Germany>How to prepare for a dog adoption in Germany</h2><p>Before rushing to an animal shelter, consider taking a few preparatory steps.</p><p>If you’re renting a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">home in Germany</a>, you must first <strong>verify with your landlord </strong>that you’re allowed to keep a dog. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German law</a>, landlords cannot strictly forbid all animals. But for larger animals — like some dogs — reasonable restrictions are permitted.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that, as long as your landlord gives you a suitable reason, they may be able to prevent you from bringing a dog into your home. For this reason, most shelters will ask you for written permission from your landlord before they let you adopt one of their dogs.</p><p>Once you have permission, take some time to consider what sort of dog you’d like. Some breeds may be more suited to your lifestyle than others. If you’re keen to go on long hikes with your dog, you may prefer a German Shepherd over a Chihuahua.&nbsp;</p><p>Age is also an important factor. While puppies are impossible to resist, they typically require more time and attention. Not only do they need training and constant surveillance, but you may also want to “dog-proof” your home by plugging up small gaps and covering electrical sockets.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-adopt-a-dog-in-Germany>How to adopt a dog in Germany</h2><p>When you’re ready, you can start the process of adopting a dog at a shelter or rescue organization.&nbsp;</p><p>Dog adoptions are a serious business in Germany. You’ll likely need to <strong>fill out an application</strong> and present your German ID card or passport. You will probably need some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">basic German</a> skills for this so come prepared! You may even need to go through a<strong> few screening steps</strong>, such as an interview, a background check and a home visit. If you’re successful, you’ll be deemed eligible to adopt a dog.</p><p>These steps may seem tedious, but they also present an opportunity to ask questions about the dog’s medical history and past circumstances. You may even be able to spend some quality time with your new furry friend to see if it’s a good match. In Germany, a Tierheim (animal shelter) usually has extensive grounds, including dog parks where you can go for walks and play together.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-cost-of-adopting-a-dog-in-Germany>The cost of adopting a dog in Germany</h2><p>One advantage of adopting a dog from a shelter rather than purchasing one from a breeder? It usually costs less.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, you’ll have to dig a little into your wallet. <strong>Animal shelters in Germany normally charge between €200 and €300</strong> (or higher, in some cases). This covers a range of unavoidable fees, such as the necessary <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">health checks</a> and vaccinations, a microchip and an EU dog passport.</p><p>This is still significantly less than what you would pay to get a dog from a breeder. In addition, if you go to a shelter, you will not be required to pay the Hundesteuer (dog tax) for the first year following the adoption of your dog.</p><p>Once the adoption is finalized, you’ll need to purchase a special type of dog liability insurance called <strong>Hundehaftpflichtversicherung</strong>. This is compulsory in many German municipalities and helps to cover any damages or injuries your dog might cause.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Your-first-steps-with-your-adopted-dog>Your first steps with your adopted dog</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the adoption process, you’ll be ready to welcome your new dog into your home.&nbsp;</p><p>But there are a few more steps to take before life with your furry friend can begin. Aside from the insurance, you’ll also need to <strong>register your dog at your local </strong><strong>Bürgeramt</strong><strong> </strong>(civic office). You should also <strong>consider signing up at a vet right away</strong>, as it can be difficult to find a good vet in an emergency.</p><p>Once these administrative tasks are out of the way, you’ll finally be able to take your dog along to all your daily activities. Germany is a fairly open and accessible country when it comes to pets. Dogs can typically enter malls and travel on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">public transportation</a>. This is yet another reason to train your dog and purchase insurance, as both steps can help to limit the risk of a non-covered incident.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>It’s a dog’s life in Germany</h2><p>In Germany, dog adoption may seem like a long process. But it’s a rewarding one. It’s also a cheaper way to get a pet, even if you’ll still have to pay a few fees.&nbsp;</p><p>Just be patient, and try not to be frustrated by all the steps involved. After all, these steps will give you the time and space to get to know your dog and prepare your home for them.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Anne-Lise-1.jpg><h2>Anne-Lise Vassoille</h2><p>Anne-Lise is a translator and copywriter working for various industries...
