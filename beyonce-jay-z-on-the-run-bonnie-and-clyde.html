They have returned to that imagery in promoting their latest tour, as with a short film called Bang Bang, the first part of which they released earlier this month. But the film’s director, Dikayl Rimmasch, told <a href=# rel=noopener>Nowness</a> that the allusion to the infamous criminals is not meant to be a literal one: “…it’s not that we’re Bonnie and Clyde,” he quotes Jay Z as saying. “We’re on the run from everything. On the run from becoming a cliché. On the run from doing the same thing again.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Which is a good thing! Because the musical power couple has very little in common with the real-life criminal couple.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As TIME <a href=# rel=noopener>reported</a> in the June 4, 1934, issue, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker Thornton weren’t just the us-against-the-world couple made famous by the 1967 movie based on their story. Cigar-smoking Bonnie had a tattoo of the name of her husband, Roy Thornton, who was in jail in Texas while she went on a spree with Clyde. Clyde “[found] sport in shooting down, without provocation, people who got in his way — filling station men, constables, plain citizens.” The two of them and their accomplices were named in 12 murder cases. When they were gunned down by police in May of 1934, their car contained a dozen guns, a saxophone, a half-eaten sandwich and $507.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, the Carters are a regular presence on the Forbes <a href=# rel=noopener>list</a> of the most powerful couples in the world. And, considering that last year they were <a href=# rel=noopener>in first place</a> for celebrity-couple earnings, they have way more than $507 and somebody’s old lunch. Their most recent potential brush with crime involved a trip to Cuba to promote educational and artistic exchange, but that didn’t end up being a crime in the first place, as the trip <a href=# rel=noopener>turned out</a> to have been approved by the U.S. government in advance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But, to be fair, it does turn out that the two couples have more in common than metaphor. Though Bonnie and Clyde never turned to songwriting, at least not that we know, the former did have a way with words. After their death, the following poem by Bonnie was found with her possessions:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bonnie.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, TIME noted, Parker’s prediction only came half true: they were buried a mile apart.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read a 2003 interview with Beyoncé, free of charge, here in TIME’s archives: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Destiny’s Adult</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbGBpfnl9jpucsqeemLJutsCyZLNln6N6tbTEZqmupl2XvK%2B6yJ5kmqaUYrCtxcOeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
