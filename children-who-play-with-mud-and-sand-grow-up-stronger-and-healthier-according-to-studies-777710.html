These same people may also have unpleasant memories of&nbsp;their parents reproaching them for being covered in&nbsp;dirt. But to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, those parents already knew that their kids were bound to&nbsp;get dirty. Let’s just say&nbsp;it: getting dirty is&nbsp;fun!</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side,</strong> we’ll explain the scientific reasons why children who play in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=sand data-link=tag>sand</a> and mud grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=# title=healthier data-link=tag>healthier</a>.</p><p><h2>Many children are disconnected from nature today.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2b/805/4fb5b25807b9eb2698b29643c5.jpg><p>It’s normal for parents to&nbsp;be&nbsp;concerned about their kids’ <a href=# title=hygiene data-link=tag>hygiene</a> and safety. Some may prefer that they play at&nbsp;home rather than in&nbsp;open spaces. Based on&nbsp;this, author <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Richard Louv</a> interviewed around 3,000&nbsp;families, and after having several conversations with children, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>concluded </a>that many don’t actually want to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;open spaces these days. They prefer to&nbsp;be&nbsp;at&nbsp;home, entertained by&nbsp;technology. “Our children and the children of&nbsp;our children are the generations that are more disconnected from <a href=# title=nature data-link=tag>nature</a> in&nbsp;history,” he&nbsp;states with concern.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;dirt never hurt anyone.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/993/92e/5911cd5616898d0f259f78415e.jpg><p>Both Louv and pediatrician <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Maria Júlia Carvalho</a> insist that children need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;touch with microorganisms that are found in&nbsp;the soil and grass to&nbsp;help develop their immune systems properly. Maybe cleaning up&nbsp;after a&nbsp;muddy mess is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pain, but finding the middle ground between fun and excess is&nbsp;something parents need to&nbsp;start thinking about. These kinds of&nbsp;unhygienic games are necessary.</p><p><h2>It’s the same with pets.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3cf/cab/cbb9f753a2bac322c7a2b324f3.png><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> published in&nbsp;the Journal of&nbsp;Allergy and Clinical Immunology, children who live and grow up&nbsp;with pets like dogs and cats from an&nbsp;early age are less inclined to&nbsp;develop allergies. These children live among constant levels of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>endotoxins</a>, a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;bacteria present in&nbsp;dust and the environment which ends up&nbsp;strengthening their immune system.</p><p><h2>This is&nbsp;how our immune system works.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/852/552/c331a45805b237e9376eca031a.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;the definition provided by&nbsp;the health system for children known as&nbsp;KidsHealth, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>immune system</a> is&nbsp;what ultimately protects people from external invaders such as&nbsp;germs and bacteria that could threaten their health. It&nbsp;accomplishes this by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>detecting</a> substances that can generate disease and infection and then fighting against them.</p><p>But for this attack to&nbsp;be&nbsp;successful, the system needs to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adapt</a> to&nbsp;microorganisms from the outside. As&nbsp;children grow, they start becoming more resistant to&nbsp;certain germs. This happens because they have already been exposed to&nbsp;them, and their immune systems already know the invaders and how to&nbsp;attack them.</p><p><h2>The consequences of&nbsp;keeping kids away from open spaces</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff3/f93/e767cb5f908bbeaccc2059ea29.jpg><p>Without coming into contact with microorganisms, the immune system becomes more vulnerable to&nbsp;substances that shouldn’t be&nbsp;pathological, like pollen or&nbsp;animal hair that cause kids to&nbsp;develop allergies. Richard Louv <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> that depriving children of&nbsp;interactions with nature <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>limits</a> the development of&nbsp;their creativity. Kids who don’t come in&nbsp;contact with their environment lack physical stimuli and have no&nbsp;direct experiences to&nbsp;build&nbsp;on.</p><p>He&nbsp;also adds that the physical activity that kids engage in&nbsp;while outside is&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy precaution against <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>obesity</a>. In&nbsp;fact, <a href=# title=obesity data-link=tag>obesity</a> affects a&nbsp;large portion of&nbsp;the child population because of&nbsp;all the time spent behind closed doors. For this reason, he&nbsp;explains that the lack of&nbsp;playtime outside is&nbsp;a&nbsp;risk to&nbsp;their psychophysical health.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you let your children play with sand and mud, or&nbsp;do&nbsp;you prefer that they engage in&nbsp;activities at&nbsp;home?
