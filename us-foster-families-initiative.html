Find out here if you’re eligible and how you can apply for the Lingoda for Foster Families initiative.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the initiative all about?</h2><p>Unaccompanied migrant children have been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">crossing the US-Mexico border in rising numbers</a>. In response, some U.S. foster parents have stepped up to offer them temporary housing until they can be reunited with their families. As a company, we admire this effort and want to empower foster parents to provide a comfortable and welcoming temporary home to migrant children. We believe sharing a common language can help to ease difficult transitional periods like this one, so we will offer free group Spanish lessons to a select number of foster parents.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How foster families can benefit from the initiative</h3><p>Lingoda will choose one hundred beneficiaries to receive the equivalent of one month of free Spanish lessons. They’ll be able to choose their own learning frequency and space out the classes over a longer period between now and February 2022.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How Lingoda is helping to promote integration through language learning</h3><p>Lingoda is a leading online language school dedicated to building bridges between cultures and improving personal and professional communication.
