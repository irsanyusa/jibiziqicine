Late last month, network heads and prominent anchors were on hand in Washington to make their pitches to an RNC panel leading the process.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Republicans have traditionally spread their debates beyond Fox News: In 2016, just 3 of the 12 matchups went to the network (two others went to Fox Business Network), and since 2012, more went to CNN than Fox News, according to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>the American Presidency Project</a>. Given the large audiences that primary debates attract, a larger concern for candidates is who will be at the moderating table, said David Kochel, a Republican who served in senior roles for the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns in 2012 and for Jeb Bush in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The party, in being the sanctioning outfit, needs to be able to say to the candidates that they gave them all an opportunity to put their best foot forward,” he said, urging the RNC to maintain influence over mainstream media moderator selections.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">McDaniel, who said members of her debate panel have passed a resolution to stay neutral throughout the nominating process, said the RNC is working to have an ideologically aligned voice asking questions on each stage, starting with the first matchup of Republican contenders in Milwaukee in August.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“We want a conservative voice in every debate,” she said, “but we also want to broaden our reach and work with partners outside just the Republican ecosystem.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But the question is larger than debates, and McDaniel hasn’t been alone in trying to reach beyond that ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Rep. Byron Donalds, a Florida conservative, recently appeared on MSNBC with progressive host Joy Reid just ahead of prime time, and amid House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s dayslong floor fight to secure his post, dozens of GOP lawmakers fanned out across CNN’s programing — an apparent reward of post-midterm outreach to Republicans on Capitol Hill by the network’s top boss that’s yet to yield an uptick in viewership among Republican voters, Morning Consult data suggests.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“I think everybody is always looking for a straightforward interview. We’re not expecting easy, but fair but tough. I think we’re hoping to see more of that on these platforms, because I don’t think it’s been that way,” McDaniel said. During her TV appearances, she said, “I always think about who’s that independent viewer I’m trying to reach.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This approach clashes with the tack often taken by the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>two top polling contenders</a> for the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination — former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Trump, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>who has seen an uptick in criticism on Fox News</a>, has spent more time recently with lower-profile outlets, while DeSantis has flooded the network’s airwaves and his office <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>apparently blacklisted MSNBC and NBC</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">DeSantis has also embraced sparring with the mainstream press, releasing an <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>advertisement in his gubernatorial campaign</a> last year that portrayed himself as a fighter against the “corporate media.” Kochel said other Republicans could try to mimic DeSantis’ antagonistic approach, using appearances on those networks to take the fight to what a number of GOP voters see as the enemy.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Democratic strategist Kevin Walling, a former surrogate for Biden’s 2020 campaign who serves as a frequent commentator on Fox News to defend his party and the president, said some Republicans are overly pugnacious, pointing to mainstream television appearances where lawmakers have portrayed the GOP as focused on oversight probes and other issues <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>few Americans see as a priority</a>.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But Kochel said competent messengers can “performatively punch back, which scores a lot of points in the Republican primary electorate” while also reaching wider audiences of potentially swayable voters — “as long as they are grounded in what the task is at hand.”&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Some of these bigger stages also offer an opportunity to make bigger mistakes,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZMGzsc2dZKydpKmys7%2BOr6atnaJisaa5zqCpmqiYnrC0edOvZKedpKy8s7fSZqmeqKWXuaqvwKeq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
