Somers recently opened up in an interview about his late sister, and why he thinks it’s important to share the story of losing her.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-singer-jb-somers-opens-up-about-his-late-sister>The Voice Singer JB Somers Opens Up About His Late Sister</h2><p>Somers’ sister Somer Johnson sadly passed away at the age of 30 after struggling with addiction. The singer told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> that it was “really cool to showcase her and to tell her story to the world” on The Voice.</p><p>“Authenticity is a gateway for people to find freedom and to see growth in their life,” Somers shared. “I really believe that’s something that’s necessary for me as an artist, especially being gay and being the brother of someone who passed away because of drug addiction. It’s really important to share those stories, because I don’t know who I’m going to end up impacting, you know? We have to be authentic if we want people to grow together as a human race.”</p><p>Somers turned Kelly Clarkson and Chance the Rapper’s chairs with his performance of Joni Mitchell’s “A Case You of You” during the Blind Auditions earlier this season. He chose to join Clarkson’s team.</p><p>“She would just have been very, very proud of me for being as authentically myself as I could be in that moment in front of some of the biggest names in music,” Somers said of his late sister. “I don’t know what she would’ve said. I think she would’ve just been very proud.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW ‘THE VOICE’ COACH CHANCE THE RAPPER PICKED HIS STAGE NAME</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-somers-released-an-ep-last-year>Somers Released an EP Last Year</h2><p>If you want to hear more from Somers, you don’t have to wait until his next The Voice appearance.
