Just four days after the event, Nammon told him she had to go help her parents with their fruit business, and that she’d be in touch.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tiamyam said he couldn’t get in touch with her after that and after a while, he received a phone call from a woman who claimed to be his wife’s niece, telling him that she had lost the baby and he shouldn’t try to contact her anymore.</p><p>The victim who claims Nammon never agreed to let him meet her parents during their nine-month relationship, only realized he had been scammed after seeing the warning post doing the rounds on Facebook.</p><p>Soon after Tiamyam’s story showed up in the media, other men came forward to accuse Nammon of scamming them out of the wedding dowry.</p><p>One man who chose to remain anonymous, said that the serial bride added him on Facebook in February of this year and tricked him into depositing a THB 500,000 ($15,000) dowry into her bank account, before disappearing.</p><p>He said she just let him know that it wasn’t a good time for her to be married because of a bad horoscope.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Another victim known only as <strong>Wichit</strong>, said that he was in contact with seven other men who had been duped by Nammon in the same manner, adding that she met all of them on Facebook, slept with them on their first date and told them that she was pregnant some months later and insisted on marriage.</p><p>After the marriage, she would promptly disappear with their wedding dowry without allowing them to meet any of her family members.</p><p>A Facebook post dated August 30, 2017, claims that Nammon 'was able to marry five different men in just one week' and dumped them all after collecting their dowries.</p><p>Police say that when they visited Nammon’s parents in Nong Khai province, they found that they had also disappeared.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The police were able to locate one of her older sisters who said that she had cut ties with the scammer a while ago after she failed to return a THB 10,000 debt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miknqyipHyzwc2arpqxXZe%2FqrDEZquhmZlivbC4yJycZqClo8Fuss6rZKydop6urXnBq6CdnV2stbB5zJqpq6GVmXp5ecyepWiuoGyFdn7T</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
