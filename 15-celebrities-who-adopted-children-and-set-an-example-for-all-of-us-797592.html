Celebrities are among the <a href=# title=families data-link=tag>families</a> that have opened their doors to&nbsp;someone else’s kids. On&nbsp;the one hand, those children are so&nbsp;lucky to&nbsp;enter a&nbsp;life of&nbsp;fame and fortune, but on&nbsp;the other, the only important thing is&nbsp;that they’re <a href=# title=loved data-link=tag>loved</a> and well taken care&nbsp;of.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>turn our attention to&nbsp;the famous people who had too much love to&nbsp;give, so&nbsp;they decided to&nbsp;make some children very happy.</p><p><h2>1. Michelle Pfeiffer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce9/983/93ea315879bb8c3ff4c84f5431.jpg><p>The famous actress decided to&nbsp;adopt her <a href=#>daughter</a>, Claudia Rose, when she was single. The adoption process was finished in&nbsp;1993, and, coincidentally, it&nbsp;also became the year <a href=# title=Pfeiffer data-link=tag>Pfeiffer</a> married her current husband, David E. Kelley. They also welcomed a&nbsp;son one year later, thus completing their family.</p><p><h2>2. Tom Cruise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fbf/c4e/3bc19857b9a78aec3bd5ccaaa8.jpg><p>Cruise shares 2&nbsp;adopted <a href=#>children</a> with his ex-wife <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a>. The former couple adopted a&nbsp;girl Isabella Jane in&nbsp;1992 and a&nbsp;boy Connor Antony in&nbsp;1995. Unfortunately, their family wasn’t meant to&nbsp;last and Tom divorced Nicole in&nbsp;2001. The actor went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;have one more child with his second ex-wife Katie Holmes, while Kidman <a href=#>shares</a> 2&nbsp;daughters with her husband Keith Urban.</p><p><h2>3. Connie Britton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45d/693/3624c35f62ac80fa39a6e2c69f.jpg><p>The Friday Night Lights <a href=#>star</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother to&nbsp;son Eyob, who she adopted from Ethiopia in&nbsp;2011. Britton once <a href=#>said</a> she’d consider adopting again, but wouldn’t rush into anything without a&nbsp;partner: “You know, somebody said to&nbsp;me&nbsp;once that you don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;outnumbered by&nbsp;your children... he&nbsp;and&nbsp;I have become such a&nbsp;great little team that&nbsp;I almost wouldn’t want to&nbsp;rock that boat. But I’m always open, for sure.”</p><p><h2>4. Hoda Kotb</h2></p><p>The Today show host waited until later in&nbsp;life to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;family and it’s paid off. She’s been with her current <a href=#>partner</a> since 2013 and together they adopted their first child, daughter Haley, in&nbsp;2017. 2&nbsp;years later, their happiness doubled when Hoda and Joel welcomed their second girl, Hope.</p><p><h2>5. Ewan McGregor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4cc/68d/5f79a45b20b147424a3d1fb5c8.jpg><p>McGregor and his wife Eve Mavrakis <a href=#>share</a> 4&nbsp;daughters together and one of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;adopted from Mongolia. In&nbsp;2017, the actor separated from his wife and since then has been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship with his Fargo co-star Mary Elizabeth Winstead.</p><p><h2>6. Frances McDormand</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2eb/f17/f301ad5d36b836a1bb560831b9.jpg><p>The Oscar-winning actress <a href=#>shares</a> one child with her husband, famous director Joel Coen. The couple adopted their son Pedro from Paraguay in&nbsp;1995. Interestingly, McDormand herself was <a href=#>adopted</a> when she was one and a&nbsp;half years old.</p><p><h2>7. Ty&nbsp;Burrell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f42/47a/c966985f078eb19505147ab109.jpg><p>The Modern Family <a href=#>star</a> truly represents his famous&nbsp;TV show as&nbsp;he&nbsp;and his wife are parents to&nbsp;2&nbsp;adopted girls. Burrell once <a href=#>revealed</a> that adoption is&nbsp;equally emotional to&nbsp;having kids by&nbsp;themselves: “In&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;ups and downs involved, we&nbsp;found them similar to&nbsp;those which our friends experienced biologically. There are extensive background searches and interviews, but really it’s about the birth mother. You hope you suit what she wants, as&nbsp;people.”</p><p><h2>8. Meg Ryan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45b/761/e7ad03507792b2fac361944daa.jpg><p>Ryan was also single when she <a href=#>adopted</a> a&nbsp;14-month-old girl from China in&nbsp;2006. For the first 4&nbsp;years, she and Daisy were on&nbsp;their own before Meg started dating singer John Mellencamp. The couple split in&nbsp;2019, but being a&nbsp;single mom again is&nbsp;nothing that Ryan can’t handle.</p><p><h2>9. Katherine Heigl</h2></p><p>Heigl always <a href=#>knew</a> she’d adopt a&nbsp;child as&nbsp;she grew up&nbsp;with her sister Meg, whom their parents adopted from <a href=# title="South Korea" data-link=tag>South Korea</a>. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, Katherine and her husband Josh Kelley have 2&nbsp;adopted <a href=#>daughters</a>: Naleigh from South Korea and Adalaide from the U.S. They also share a&nbsp;son, who was born in&nbsp;2016.</p><p><h2>10. Kristin Davis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/23d/7ae/12178c5d7fb4463b1b56c30034.jpg><p>The Sex and the City star <a href=#>raises</a> her 2&nbsp;adopted children by&nbsp;herself: daughter Gemma, whom she welcomed in&nbsp;2011, and son Wilson, who joined their family in&nbsp;2018. For Davis, the biggest <a href=#>priority</a> is&nbsp;educating herself to&nbsp;have Gemma and Wilson grow up&nbsp;as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the African-American community as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;she can.</p><p><h2>11. Harrison Ford</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c29/7e5/b591b2586094bb2af8d7697306.jpg><p><a href=#>Ford</a> became a&nbsp;father to&nbsp;an&nbsp;adopted boy, Liam, in&nbsp;2002 through his relationship with Calista Flockhart. She adopted her son a&nbsp;year before getting together with the famous actor and he&nbsp;was willing to&nbsp;join her on&nbsp;this journey through parenthood. The couple married in&nbsp;2010. Harrison also has 4&nbsp;adult children of&nbsp;his own from 2&nbsp;previous marriages.</p><p><h2>12. Angelina Jolie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c6/16f/b8289c53828a97dad4c5bc4b94.jpg><p>Jolie famously has 3&nbsp;adopted <a href=#>children</a>: son Maddox from Cambodia, daughter Zahara from Ethiopia, and son Pax from Vietnam. In&nbsp;2006, her ex-husband Brad Pitt also officially adopted Angelina’s children. They went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;have 3&nbsp;more biological kids. The couple <a href=#>divorced</a> in&nbsp;2019 and reached a&nbsp;joint custody agreement.</p><p><h2>13. Lionel Richie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/728/1d8/2e75fd5f9b959c6524b094efff.jpg><p>The famous singer and his first wife informally <a href=#>adopted</a> daughter Nicole in&nbsp;1983 when she was 2&nbsp;years old. 7&nbsp;years later, Richie made the adoption official and still continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving father to&nbsp;the reality show <a href=#>star</a>. Lionel later got divorced from Nicole’s mom and had 2&nbsp;more children with his second wife.</p><p><h2>14. Cate Blanchett</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b00/ea4/b9832955d8bb4dde6cd2d8118d.jpg><p>Blanchett and her husband Andrew Upton <a href=#>adopted</a> their daughter Edith in&nbsp;2015 while already being parents to&nbsp;3&nbsp;biological children. The actress once <a href=#>revealed</a> that they’d wanted to&nbsp;adopt ever since the birth of&nbsp;their first son and said that all of&nbsp;her kids were extremely welcoming to&nbsp;their adoptive sister.</p><p><h2>15. Emma Thompson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce5/d38/a00935571fa12544c522e1e4ee.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2003, Thompson had 2&nbsp;men officially enter her <a href=#>life</a>: her husband David Wise, who she’d been with since 1995, and their adopted son Tindyebwa Agaba. Emma revealed that they met Tindyebwa when he&nbsp;was 16&nbsp;years old, during a&nbsp;Refugee Council, and invited him to&nbsp;spend Christmas with them. The family got very close to&nbsp;the boy and, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, decided to&nbsp;adopt him. The couple also has a&nbsp;daughter named Gaia.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have any experience with adoption?
