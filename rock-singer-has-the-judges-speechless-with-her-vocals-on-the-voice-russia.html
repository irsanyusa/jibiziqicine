The judges were automatically obsessed with the singer the minute she hit the chorus of the song, which isn’t a very easy song to sing. She even had judge Dima Bilan rocking along with her at one point. Although Bilan was the first to turn his chair and seemed to be the most excited during her performance, she ended up going with Leonid Agutin as her coach for Season 5.</strong></p><p class=has-text-align-center>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>SINGER FUSES COUNTRY & ROCK IN INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE ON ‘THER VOICE FRANCE’</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWtQqhYcK1Q</p></figure><p>Her audition on The Voice didn’t just make the judges go crazy, but also the fans. Her audition has 30 million views on Youtube, which isn’t shocking considering her amazing talent. Even though it took place in 2016, people are still rocking out to her audition four years later.</p><p>One commenter even said: “It’s not an audition, It’s a concert.” Another fan wrote: “This is my favorite cover of ZOMBIE because the sense of desperation and rage really capture the true meaning of this song to me. Thanks Daria!!!”</p><p>Daria did make it far in the competition and performed other iconic hits that go with her strong voice such as&nbsp; “Chandelier” by Sia in the Semi-Finals, “Ripples on Water” in the Knockouts, and “Army of Me” in the Quarter Finals.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>KELLY CLARKSON WILL OPEN UP ABOUT DIVORCE IN HER NEXT ALBUM</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-daria-now>Where is Daria now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CPoiOy0FQNM/</p></figure><p>Following her performance on ‘The Voice Russia,’ Daria was featured on the list of “Hottest Chicks in Hard Rock” of “Revolver.”&nbsp;She is still singing rock music to this day and she currently is in a Russian metal band called Slot.</p><p>Slot was formed in 2002, so before her blind audition she had already started a music career. The band has released eight albums. Their first album sold thousands of copies and some of the songs were even featured on MTV such as “Odni.”</p><p>Years later, the band continues to have major success as their fourth studio album was popular in non-Russian speaking countries like the United Kingdom, Unites States, and Canada leading them to release their first English single “Mirrors.” They continued releasing English music following the success of the single with their debut English album “Break The Code” in 2011. The single of the same name was featured in 55 American stations, ranking number two in the Metal Radio Station Add Chart.</p><p>Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the group played in a major music festival in Slovakia named the Nashestvie, which is the largest rock festival in Russia and is organized by Nashe Radio station. It is held annually during the first weekend of July.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sethward-3-e1622820449540.jpg alt="‘AGT’s Sethward Finally Makes it Onto the Show After Years of Failed Auditions" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>blind auditions</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the voice russia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570aiapGWjnruosdFmn5qrXam1pnnJrpugnaNiwLGxxJyfpZ2jqHq4tdOhZKGdomLDsK%2FApapmp55iwamxjK%2BmopuVYr%2B2v9KimGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
