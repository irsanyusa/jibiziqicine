Born on Sept. 12, 1997 in Spokane, Wash., Sweeney started acting in her early teenage years and moved to Los Angeles at the age of 14 to pursue her career. She started out by booking small roles on shows like "90210," "Criminal Mind," "Grey's Anatomy" and "Pretty Little Liars" before breaking through with supporting parts in "Everything Sucks!," "Sharp Objects" and "The Handmaid's Tale." Sweeney earned mainstream recognition when she was cast in the HBO series "Euphoria" as Cassie Howard, a teenager with a promiscuous reputation. In 2022, she received an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series for her performance in the show's second season. At the same time, Sweeney turned heads in a different HBO show -- Mike White's "The White Lotus," in which she portrayed a cynical college student on vacation with her family in Hawaii. That performance earned her another supporting actress Emmy nod in the limited or anthology series category, making her double-nominated that year. Sweeney's star continued to rise with her portrayal of whistleblower Reality Winner in 2022's "Reality," which premiered at Berlin Film Festival to critical acclaim. She has also started her own production company, Fifty-Fifty Films, which released its first project in December 2023 with the rom-com hit "Anyone but You." The film stars Sweeney and Glen Powell in a modernized adaptation of Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing" and performed well at the box office. Up next for Sweeney is her Marvel debut in "Madame Web" as Julia Carpenter/Spider-Woman, the horror film "Immaculate" and thriller "Echo Valley" alongside Julianne Moore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BpfLTFw6ecsmWjrLKmusSyZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
