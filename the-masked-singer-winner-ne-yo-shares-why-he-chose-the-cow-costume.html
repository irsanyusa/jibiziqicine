In a new interview, the singer opened up about why he chose the unexpected costume.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-masked-singer-winner-ne-yo-talks-about-his-costume>The Masked Singer Winner Ne-Yo Talks About His Costume</h2><p>Ne-Yo told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> that he’s friendly with both The Masked Singer host Nick Cannon and panelists Robin Thicke and Nicole Scherzinger, so he was determined to throw them off the scent. Part of that involved unconventional song choices.</p><p>“We picked songs that were slightly outside of my wheelhouse, songs that you wouldn’t regularly expect to hear me singing,” he shared. “I was very, very adamant about, ‘Listen guys, I do not want to get discovered quickly. Let’s figure out ways to throw them off.’”</p><p>He also chose an unconventional costume to further confuse the panelists, explaining, “When the producers came to me with the costume, they were like, ‘We want you to be a cow, but we’re going to give you a choice. You can be a male cow or potentially, maybe, if you want, a female cow.’ I instantly was like, ‘Oh, female cow, let’s go. Let’s do the female cow, all day.'”</p><p>Ne-Yo said the costume gave him “the opportunity to do a little acting.” Since he grew up around a lot of women, the singer said it wasn’t hard to embody the Cow’s “female mannerisms.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EVERYTHING YOU MISSED ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ HOLIDAY SING-ALONG</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-will-he-keep-his-trophy>Where Will He Keep His Trophy?</h2><p>Like all the winners of The Masked Singer, Ne-Yo received the Golden Mask trophy in the Season 10 finale. The singer told People that the trophy will stay at his mother’s house, where he also keeps his Grammys and other awards.</p><p>“My mom has this huge cabinet full of my accomplishments,” Ne-Yo explained, “and we have moved things around and prepared a space for that big, beautiful golden&nbsp;Masked Singer&nbsp;trophy, right next to the Grammys.”</p><p>Ne-Yo is gearing up to kick off his Champagne and Roses Tour in March.
