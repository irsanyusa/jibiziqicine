For one man, the pressure reached a&nbsp;breaking point, leading to&nbsp;a&nbsp;radical solution.</p><p>In&nbsp;November 2022, my&nbsp;wife passed away, leaving me&nbsp;with three adult stepchildren. Despite being in&nbsp;their lives for over a&nbsp;decade, they’ve always been clear that I&nbsp;am not their parent. Their biological father has retired to&nbsp;the Philippines.</p><p>The stepchildren, aged 21, 22, and&nbsp;25, faced the high cost of&nbsp;living in&nbsp;our city. We&nbsp;provided them with a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;live, charging no&nbsp;rent so&nbsp;they could save money. The youngest is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;school, while the other two are employed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39b/324/72b8585e7f8750e34486850bda.jpg><p>However, after their mother’s passing, they stopped contributing to&nbsp;household chores. I&nbsp;covered all the bills—power, water, Internet, and utilities—and even provided food for the youngest. Frustrated, I&nbsp;hired a&nbsp;cleaning lady to&nbsp;help manage the mess.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a53/2f9/579e915971ac6a83a99ab7dbc9.jpg><p>Finally, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;sell the house. Its value had skyrocketed since&nbsp;I purchased&nbsp;it, and&nbsp;I could retire comfortably in&nbsp;the Philippines. The sale happened swiftly, and&nbsp;I moved to&nbsp;my&nbsp;cabin. Each stepchild received $10,000, and&nbsp;I informed them of&nbsp;the sale. They weren’t oblivious; they’d seen the “For Sale” sign and attended open houses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a66/b46/caef4a57d5aae66cfb9733f79f.jpg><p>Now, they’re upset about losing their home. While they grew up&nbsp;there, they never treated it&nbsp;as&nbsp;more than a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;sleep. I&nbsp;believe their late mother would be&nbsp;disappointed by&nbsp;their behavior.</p><p>They pooled their money for an&nbsp;apartment but relying solely on&nbsp;my&nbsp;gift, they’ll face financial struggles within a&nbsp;year.</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;his side.</h2></p><ul><li>“Raise your hand if&nbsp;your parents gave you $10k when you moved out. No&nbsp;hands? You separated from leeches.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oddjibberz&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“They were disrespectful to&nbsp;you and your home, and you weren’t obligated to&nbsp;continue providing for them, especially after they became adults.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Xoxo_emmmaa&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“You gave them nearly two years to&nbsp;start picking up&nbsp;after themselves and acting like they wanted to&nbsp;live there. They didn’t. If&nbsp;seeing for sale signs and open houses didn’t get them to&nbsp;realize that that’s not really on&nbsp;you. You also didn’t have to&nbsp;give them money to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;their own, but you did.<br>You’ve done enough, considering that they’re adults. It&nbsp;sounds like if&nbsp;they had been picking up&nbsp;after themselves, you probably wouldn’t have wanted to&nbsp;sell.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Liss78&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06c/a62/635c20558bb5d2b631a04a980d.jpg><ul><li>“You’re right&nbsp;— their mom would be&nbsp;disgusted with how her children behaved in&nbsp;your home, in&nbsp;which they were, ultimately, guests. Enjoy your newfound freedom from entitled adults.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Current-Anybody9331&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“I&nbsp;sold my&nbsp;house to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;a&nbsp;freeloading, lazy brother, and my&nbsp;siblings blamed me&nbsp;for making him homeless. He&nbsp;was 59. Yet they wouldn’t take him&nbsp;in. Some people will take advantage of&nbsp;you rather than standing on&nbsp;their own two feet.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shockingRn&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“These people are adults. They have made it&nbsp;clear that you are not their father, presumably meaning that you can not tell them what to&nbsp;do. Not only have they been living in&nbsp;your house rent-free, but they haven’t done their share of&nbsp;the housework, expecting you to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;or&nbsp;pay for&nbsp;it.<br>However, since you are indeed not their father, you don’t owe them anything. You were generous to&nbsp;let them live in&nbsp;your house for over a&nbsp;year, and very generous to&nbsp;give them money to&nbsp;start their independent life. Now they will have to&nbsp;take responsibility for their finances and housekeeping&nbsp;— or&nbsp;experience homelessness and realize that they indeed have to&nbsp;take responsibility.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>DawnShakhar&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLauedKeo6Whnpx6rsWMoaamnV2pvG6x0pyYqZ1dm7%2BwuYysq56ok522rbDRnqVmnKKWuqJ5l2pwb29kZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
