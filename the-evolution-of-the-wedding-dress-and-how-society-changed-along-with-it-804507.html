Aside from being a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;happily ever after, wedding dresses can tell&nbsp;us a&nbsp;lot about social and cultural norms of&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain era.</p><p>Inspired by&nbsp;gorgeous designs and the intriguing historical facts behind each of&nbsp;them, the <strong>Bright Side</strong> editorial team takes you on&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey of&nbsp;wedding dress evolution.</p><p><h2>Contrary to&nbsp;the popular belief, the white wedding dress has not always been a&nbsp;trend.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a0/4b4/f752125cf0a50e4241538cdbfa.jpg><p>In&nbsp;ancient Rome, where <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>weddings</a> were considered an&nbsp;important social event, brides wore long draped veils in&nbsp;a&nbsp;deep <strong>yellow or&nbsp;orange color</strong>. These warm colors <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>represented</a> “the color of&nbsp;the flame,” symbolizing the warmth and light that brides would bring to&nbsp;their husbands’ homes. The trends in&nbsp;ancient <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Greece</a> were similar. Brides wore loosely-fitted long dresses and veils in&nbsp;the colors of&nbsp;fire to&nbsp;scare away evil spirits.</p><p>Back then, marriage was more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>legal transaction</a> rather than a&nbsp;romantic occasion. The brides would simply pick the best dress that they already had rather than making or&nbsp;purchasing a&nbsp;separate dress for the wedding ceremony. A&nbsp;similar practice continued into the middle ages, although the color of&nbsp;bridal wear continued to&nbsp;change.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;the middle ages, blue became the new yellow.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/734/272/0b13f756258dafe5873de625d6.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the middle ages, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>blue</a> was often associated with <strong>purity and royalty</strong>, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;comes as&nbsp;no&nbsp;surprise that this color became a&nbsp;common choice for medieval bridal dresses. Yellow, red, green, and other jewel-toned <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gowns</a> were also popular, especially among women of&nbsp;a&nbsp;higher social status.</p><p>Floor-length, wide necklines, and fitted bodices are the most distinctive <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>features</a>of&nbsp;medieval wedding dress silhouettes that are still often recreated today. Some royal brides, like <strong>Charlene Wittstock,</strong> <strong>the Princess of&nbsp;Monaco, went for a&nbsp;blue wedding outfit </strong>for her civil wedding ceremony.</p><p><h2>Extravagant royal weddings were the name of&nbsp;the game in&nbsp;the 1700s and 1800s.</h2></p><p>Although luxurious wedding ceremonies were still uncommon in&nbsp;the <strong>1700s and 1800s</strong>, bridal gowns became more lavish and elaborate. At&nbsp;that time, the French court dictated the fashion trends, with Marie Antoinette leading the way. While common women still kept their wedding ceremonies <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>private</a> and modest, royals were taking it&nbsp;over the top.</p><p>Her scandalously expensive gown was constructed of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cloth-of-silver</a> <strong>adorned with diamonds</strong>, but it&nbsp;didn’t fit her properly because it&nbsp;was made before she even arrived in&nbsp;France. Without having the chance to&nbsp;try the dress on&nbsp;in&nbsp;time, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bodice</a> ended up&nbsp;too small, so&nbsp;aside from the cost, the ill-fitted wedding gown was another subject of&nbsp;gossip at&nbsp;that time.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;wasn’t until the late 1800s that the white wedding dress became widespread.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ab/443/cfa0eb5c1d86deabf945506597.jpg><p>On&nbsp;her wedding day, <strong><a href=# title="Queen Victoria" data-link=tag>Queen Victoria</a></strong> said that she would make her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>vows</a> to&nbsp;Prince Albert as&nbsp;his future wife, not as&nbsp;the queen. So, instead of&nbsp;the traditional coronation robe, she choose a&nbsp;white satin <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gown</a> trimmed with lace to&nbsp;symbolize her decision. This inspired other future brides to&nbsp;express their feelings and <strong>personal preferences through their wedding dress choice</strong>.</p><p>Until then, many women didn’t consider trying to&nbsp;obtain this luxury simply because the white color was difficult to&nbsp;maintain in&nbsp;a&nbsp;world without a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>washing machine</a> and running water.</p><p><h2>Looser gowns hit the stage with the new, Edwardian era.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e3/44a/ba16a75229902fe58dcf5af78a.jpg><p>With the approach of&nbsp;the 20th century, the shape of&nbsp;Victorian wedding dresses changed. The bodice became looser, the skirt less voluminous, and the veil became a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>standard</a>. Brides of&nbsp;this era often wore high-neck dresses with long sleeves and plenty of&nbsp;<strong>lace details</strong>.</p><p>Technological developments in&nbsp;the<strong> 1920s and 1930s </strong>brought <strong>more freedom to&nbsp;women</strong>, which was reflected in&nbsp;the latest fashion of&nbsp;that time. Flapper <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>style</a> was a&nbsp;huge trend, making bridal attire considerably more flirty and loose.</p><p><h2>The 1920s were the turning point in&nbsp;fashion history.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2b/73b/78e6fb573ba930a7c883992bb6.jpg><p>To&nbsp;balance out a&nbsp;rather <strong>simple silhouette, extra-long veils </strong>were in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fashion</a>. Since the construction of&nbsp;the dress was less elaborate, more women were able to&nbsp;afford a&nbsp;wedding dress of&nbsp;their choice. And by&nbsp;the mid 20th century, the white color of&nbsp;the bride’s dress would soon become the norm.</p><p>In&nbsp;the <strong>1930s</strong> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fashion</a> was drawing<strong> inspiration from movies</strong>. Of&nbsp;course, gowns worn by&nbsp;movie stars were designer-made and accessible only to&nbsp;the rich, but copies of&nbsp;those dresses became attainable for all budgets. This decade also brought the first bridal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>magazines</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wider audience.</p><p><h2>Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of&nbsp;Windsor, opted for a&nbsp;more modest look for her 1937&nbsp;wedding.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/74e/258/0b970258f0895dc1fb3149ea7d.jpg><p>Wedding bells didn’t stop ringing even in&nbsp;the <strong>1940s </strong>when the world was facing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>turbulent times</a>. Luxurious fabrics like silk and satin were in&nbsp;short supply, which is&nbsp;why many brides chose to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;dress they already had or&nbsp;to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;new one that could be&nbsp;worn again after the ceremony. Wearing their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mother’s</a> wedding outfits was another option. Brides living in&nbsp;big cities also had the option of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>renting</a> a&nbsp;wedding dress.</p><p><h2>1940s wedding dress styles varied from very formal to&nbsp;business attire.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fca/4c4/5e55b05609b231bbfe0c676094.jpg><p>The emergence of&nbsp;big fashion houses in&nbsp;the ’50s, like <strong>Dior</strong>, launched a&nbsp;new silhouette that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>redefined</a> bridal style. A&nbsp;<strong>small waist and a&nbsp;full skirt </strong>was the hottest <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>trend</a> at&nbsp;that time, which was also often seen in&nbsp;wedding gowns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/994/98c/75c875586badf6383733ab7977.jpg><p>The legendary wedding dress worn by&nbsp;Liz Taylor in&nbsp;the 1950 movie <i>Father of&nbsp;the Bride</i> incorporated everything that was considered <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fashionable</a> at&nbsp;that time. The same <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>designer</a>, Helen Rose, later created a&nbsp;similar timeless dress for <a href=# title="Grace Kelly" data-link=tag>Grace Kelly</a>’s wedding.</p><p><h2>The ’50s saw a&nbsp;return to&nbsp;formality and big ball gowns after wartime weddings.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a94/a45/b1206256669d96fb1ea65a8e5d.jpg><p>Although church weddings required a&nbsp;modest dress with covered shoulders, hands, and legs, women of&nbsp;that era still wanted to&nbsp;try something modern. The simplicity of&nbsp;<strong><a href=# title="Audrey Hepburn" data-link=tag>Audrey Hepburn</a>’s iconic wedding dress</strong> in ’’<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Funny Face</a>’’ was a&nbsp;breath of&nbsp;fresh air, sporting a&nbsp;tea-length dress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d8/115/654f365e65a3d1f2e3e73dc65a.jpg><p>From <strong>1960 to&nbsp;1969</strong> fashion trends changed faster than perhaps during any other period in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>history</a>, and bridal attire was no&nbsp;exception. After a&nbsp;decade of&nbsp;crinolines and petticoats, brides in&nbsp;the 1960s opted for a&nbsp;sleeker, more sophisticated <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>look</a>.</p><p><h2>Brides of&nbsp;the ’60s also didn’t shy away from bold and bright colors, like in&nbsp;ancient times.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e97/422/13cb9c519ebef585c37db8b93a.jpg><p>As&nbsp;women were becoming more empowered, skirt hemlines grew <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shorter</a>. Trains and veils significantly reduced in&nbsp;length, vanishing almost completely as&nbsp;the <strong>minidress</strong> became trendy. While the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>popularity</a> of&nbsp;miniskirt wedding dresses has declined over the years, the slim silhouette has lived&nbsp;on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f00/101/4e9e205930890ca86688f460ee.jpg><p>The hippy era of&nbsp;the <strong>1970s revived a&nbsp;long, flowy style</strong> and a&nbsp;looser waistline. One of&nbsp;the main points of ’70s fashion was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>individuality</a>, reflected in&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;bold fabric patterns, statement sleeves, and accessories.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d65/a92/118b9c53dab36c1639cf5801be.jpg><p><strong>Some brides chose to&nbsp;replace veils with sophisticated hats </strong>and even pants and jackets became a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;bridal attire. More than ever before, beautiful and extravagant wedding dresses were available to&nbsp;anyone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/605/a48/2b2bda569d926447e008c03ab4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;contrast, <strong>the ’80s were all about glamour and volume</strong>: puffed sleeves, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>big</a> skirts, oversized ruffles and bows, and fairytale-inspired veils. Another signature trait of ’80s bridal trends and fashion, in&nbsp;general, were gowns with sheer elements, plenty of&nbsp;lace, and chunky jewelry.</p><p><h2>Princess Diana’s iconic wedding dress set the tone for ’80s bridal fashion.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d26/6a1/f8bd035fe8bb61f4061b7b0af7.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the <strong>1990s and 2000s, </strong>celebrity weddings hit the front covers of&nbsp;fashion magazines, inspiring a&nbsp;plethora of&nbsp;weird and amazing wedding gown <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>designs</a>. As&nbsp;church <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>weddings</a> became less fashionable, <strong>silhouettes got more revealing</strong>, and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>strapless</a> bodice is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;favorite choice from this era.</p><p><h2>From oversized shoulders of&nbsp;the ’80s to&nbsp;off-shoulder wedding dresses of&nbsp;the ’90s</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d2/e7f/932946540d8d09d78842aac515.jpg><p>The<strong> late ’90s </strong>marked the comeback of&nbsp;simplicity.

The early 2000s were about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>simplicity</a>, <strong>strapless gowns,</strong> or&nbsp;gowns with spaghetti straps. As&nbsp;<strong>destination weddings</strong> became more widespread, the need for practical wedding attire dictated the trend.</p><p><h2>Simplicity became the trademark of&nbsp;the early 2000s.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eac/923/4a639f58ffabc835432bc60700.jpg><p>Over the past 10&nbsp;years, we’ve seen <strong>new styles invented and old styles reemerged</strong>, and it&nbsp;seems that there is&nbsp;more diversity than ever, with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>figure-hugging</a> mermaid gown being one of&nbsp;the most popular choices in&nbsp;the 2010s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/48d/dfe/f25be35f6091b0673afd935576.jpg><p><h2>And we&nbsp;also witnessed some unforgettable dramatic gowns in&nbsp;the past decade.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/493/830/599af65accab2e668618399a6b.jpg><p><h2>As&nbsp;well as&nbsp;some provocative but minimal bridal looks!</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f68/717/94516556a1acd5494b78b648dc.jpg><p>Centuries came and went, and the white wedding dress has held its own in&nbsp;history no&nbsp;matter the circumstances.
