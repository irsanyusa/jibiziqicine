It’s his first post on the platform since June. As the singer wrote in the caption, “Looking forward to this next chapter of my life.”</p><p>Hardy was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested in April 2022 </a>after he was accused of spying on a female student at Louisiana State University. He allegedly planted a listening device in her residence to record her conversations. To avoid jail time, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hardy enrolled</a> in a pretrial diversion program.</p><p>“I’ve learned to just simply be grateful for anything, good/bad, positive/negative. It shapes you from who you were to how you were to how you are to who you are now,” Hardy wrote in his new post. “God’s word became a crutch for me throughout this process & it will stick like glue forever. He loves & accepts everyone, I’m no different than any of you. He’s a prayer away!”</p><p>Fans shared their support for the singer in the comments, with one person writing that they hope his “next chapter” includes new music. Hardy responded, “Well of course if that’s his will.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘AMERICAN IDOL’ WINNER LAINE HARDY SHARES NEW SONG ABOUT WANTING TO BETTER HIMSELF</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hardy-parted-ways-with-his-record-label>Hardy Parted Ways with His Record Label</h2><p>Last October, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hardy shared</a> on social media that he was parting ways with his record label, 19 Entertainment and Disney Music Group. He added that it was “time for me to take my career in a new direction.”</p><p>The singer has made sporadic social media appearances in the months since his arrest last year, sometimes to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">share original music</a> with fans. In June of this year, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a photo</a> of himself on a couch with his guitar beside him, writing on a notepad. He captioned it, “To be continued.”</p><p>Hardy first auditioned for American Idol Season 16, making it to the Top 50. He joined his friend Ashton Gill to play guitar in her Season 17 audition, and the judges encouraged him to audition as well. This time, Hardy made it to the finale and was named the winner.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_TomSandoval_ArianaMadix_JC-OliveraGetty-Images-for-iHeartRadio-220x147.jpeg alt="Ariana Madix Gushes About New Boyfriend as Tom Sandoval Opens Up About Affair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>laine hardy</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2avmaO7pr6MpZiippVitaK%2Bw7Jkq52kqr%2Bvv4ytpmarn5i2oriMppydoZFis7C%2BjKecsaxdmLWivNOeqWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
