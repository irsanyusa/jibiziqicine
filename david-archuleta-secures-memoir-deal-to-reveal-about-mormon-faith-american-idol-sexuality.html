The pop singer recently has signed a memoir deal. Within the memoir, the singer will discuss his journey from being a Mormon to discovering his sexuality.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-david-archuleta-to-share-my-story-with-new-memoir>David Archuleta To “Share My Story” with New Memoir</h2><p>Archuleta is yet to reveal the title of his memoir, but the singer promises that the book will be revelatory. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Crush” hitmaker</a> landed the book deal with HarperCollins imprint Dey Street Books.</p><p>The pop singer will discuss his journey nearly 16 years after he found fame through <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a>. His memoir will tackle his upbringing as a devoted Mormon, his decision to put his career on hold to finish a mission trip to Chile. He will also discuss his unexpected coming out during the pandemic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“Through encouragement from friends, I’ve decided it’s important to share my story,” he said. “I hope it will help others understand the struggles those in the LGBTQ+ community have coming out in religious communities, provide light to anyone navigating difficult family dynamics or faith transitions, and encourage everyone to give more room to love yourself.”</p><p>This year, Archuleta is expected to collaborate with producers and writers to kick off his new era. There, the singer will showcase the “next chapter of his artistic evolution and continued touring career.” Furthermore, Archuleta has signed a deal with Mainstay Entertainment and the Chicane Group.</p><p>“David is not only a beloved star and undeniable talent but also an impactful artist whose story will resonate universally, inspiring others as it has inspired us. He stands poised to hit even greater heights as he embarks upon this new chapter,” his new reps said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-coming-out-was-a-shock-to-his-fanbase>His Coming Out was a Shock to His Fanbase</h2><p>In 2021, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Archuleta</a> sent his fans into a media frenzy when he came out as part of the LGBTQIA+ community. In a now-deleted Instagram post, the singer-songwriter bravely opened up about his sexuality.</p><p>“I like to keep to myself but also thought this was important to share because I know so many other people from religious upbringings feel the same way,” he wrote. “I’ve been open to myself and my close family for some years now that I am not sure about my own sexuality.”</p><p>His coming out story wasn’t an anticipated news for his fan base as it’s no secret that he’s maintained his faith as a Mormon for years. Nevertheless, despite his shocking revelation, Archuleta showed overpouring support from the public.</p><p>Since then, Archuleta has been open about his past struggles as a Mormon and a confused child. In 2021, the American Idol alum revealed that he had to do some soul-searching when he began to accept his gender identity.</p><p>“It got to a point where I was praying, like, ‘God, if you are really there, please take this away from me because I don’t know what else to do.’ And finally, there was just a moment where my understanding of God said, ‘You need to stop asking me this. You’re not supposed to change yourself because this is how you are. You are created to be this way,'” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “That was just the most freeing thing for me.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Original_SimonCowell_LaurenSilverman_Eric_David-LivingstonGetty-Images.jpg alt="Simon Cowell’s Son Eric is a Literal Mini Me of His Dad in New Photos" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>David Archuleta</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qtopxdlr%2BktNSlnK2ZXaiypMHRnqpmpZWivKq%2BjJ2cmqRdqbxuvsSvnJqkXZavsMHTZqSoqp2ku26ywKKroWWRorKztcKapWahlKS5br%2FEsayapJmpxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
