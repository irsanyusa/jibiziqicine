According to Mandel, he caught the virus in April at the Kids’ Choice Awards, where AGT took home a trophy.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-howie-mandel-says-he-got-covid-19-at-the-kids-choice-awards>Howie Mandel Says He Got Covid-19 at the Kids’ Choice Awards</h2><p>On April 9, AGT won the Kids’ Choice Award in the Reality Show category. Mandel attended the event with his fellow judges (Heidi Klum, Sofia Vergara, and Simon Cowell) and host Terry Crews. Unfortunately, he later tested positive for Covid-19.</p><p>Fallon was shocked that Mandel actually got sick, <a href=# class=broken_link>since he’s so germaphobic</a>. Mandel admitted that he doesn’t go many places, but he shared, “They made me go to the Kids’ Choice Awards, and a lot of people get slimed. I went viral.”</p><p>Mandel was vaccinated and boosted, so he said the hardest part of his Covid experience was being stuck in one room. He took a lighthearted tone when talking to Fallon, but Mandel <a href=#>previously said</a> the isolation led to “mental pain,” adding, “I went insane.”</p><p>We believe Mandel’s COVID-19 diagnosis is the explanation for his disappearance in the AGT auditions. While this has yet to be confirmed, it’s important to remember that AGT filmed auditions from April 1 through 11. The AGT judges appeared at this award show mid filming on April 9.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>SIMON COWELL, HOWIE MANDEL GET KEYS TO THE LAS VEGAS STRIP IN TEARFUL CEREMONY</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-thinks-simon-cowell-should-stay-off-the-bike>He Thinks Simon Cowell Should Stay Off the Bike</h2><p>Mandel, who also judges Canada’s Got Talent, shared his excitement that AGT is returning for Season 17 on May 31. He confirmed that the entire judging panel is back this season, adding, “Simon is back on the bike, which he shouldn’t be.”</p><p>He was referring to the electric bike Cowell was riding when he fell and broke his back in 2020. Earlier this year, <a href=#>he fell off again</a> and broke his arm. Cowell also recently got engaged, and Mandel speculated that it might be related to the fall.</p><p>“He broke his back, he broke his arm, he had a concussion. And then he got engaged,” Mandel joked. Of course, <a href=#>Cowell’s engagement</a> to his partner Lauren Silverman happened before his second fall, so we’re pretty sure they were unconnected.</p><p>Mandel continued to joke, saying, “He’s registered at Target, if anybody wants to get them something.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-151388626.jpg alt="10 Talent Show Contestants That Found Success, But Didn’t Win Their Show" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrrGWYpMSqsYymmKeclaF6tK3YrGShnV2cvLV5wqitopxdZoZurdNmq6GdXaC2pb%2BMnJ%2BooZOaeqLDwKubrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
