Others <a href=#>charged</a> include two doctors and Perry’s personal assistant. Prosecutors said that Sangha and one of the doctors, 42-year-old Salvador Plasencia, were arrested on Thursday and accused of distributing ketamine to Perry during the final weeks of his life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Perry, 54, was found face down in his hot tub on Oct. 28, 2023. The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office later <a href=#>determined</a> that Perry died as a result of “the acute effects of ketamine.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Authorities said they have also tied Sangha to a previous fatal overdose. Here’s what to know about Sangha.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What charges is she facing?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An indictment unsealed on Thursday alleges that Sangha’s distribution of ketamine on Oct. 24, 2023, caused Perry’s death. A <a href=#>dual citizen</a> of the U.S. and Great Britain, Sangha is facing nine counts related to Perry’s death, including: conspiracy to distribute ketamine, maintaining a drug-involved premises, possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and ketamine, and five counts of distribution of ketamine. She was arraigned in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday and pleaded not guilty. If convicted of all charges, she could face a maximum sentence of life in prison, prosecutors said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The judge denied her request for bail on Thursday, and she will remain in custody. Her next hearing is scheduled for Oct. 15.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Why have her authorities dubbed her the “Ketamine Queen?”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prosecutors accuse Sangha of distributing ketamine, as well as other illegal drugs, from her North Hollywood “stash house” since at least 2019. U.S. Attorney for California’s Central District Martin Estrada said during a <a href=#>news conference</a> on Thursday that her home was a “drug-selling emporium.” He added that a search of her home turned up more than 80 vials of ketamine, as well as drugs, including methamphetamine, cocaine, and Xanax.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prosecutors <a href=#>accused</a> Sangha of being “aware of the danger of ketamine.” In August 2019, she allegedly sold ketamine to a man named Cody McLaury just hours before he died of an overdose, according to prosecutors. After a relative of McLaury’s texted Sangha that her ketamine had killed McLaury, Sangha searched on Google: “Can ketamine be listed as a cause of death[?]”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of the defendants who pleaded guilty on Aug. 8 to charges in connection with Perry’s death, Erik Fleming, is <a href=#>quoted</a> in the indictment as saying about Sangha: she “only deal[s] with high end and celebs.” Sangha previously shared photos of her extravagant lifestyle on social media, from parties to vacations in Japan and Mexico, <a href=#>BBC</a> reported.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGFmhXR%2FjqOYrK6Vmrtuv8CnnqGZXaCyta3MoqWeZaGqsqa6jKaYrayYmsRuvMSrqbJllJqutbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
