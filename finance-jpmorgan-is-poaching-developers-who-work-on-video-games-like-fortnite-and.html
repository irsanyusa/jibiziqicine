It's actually been very exciting."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Anecdotally, Smith said that a number of the developers he's spoken with have left careers developing video games to join JPMorgan.</p><p>"It's actually been very easy," Smith told Erika Najarian, an equity-research head at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, at the conference.</p><p>While state-of-the art tech offices — in addition to Hudson Yards, the firm in September <a href=# id=e0ef8e80-4cd3-5c5d-b1ee-05817ae1df35>announced a new fintech office in Palo Alto</a> to house 1,000 employees — likely help, the scale of JPMorgan's opportunity is what Smith highlighted. Here's the exchange:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Smith:</strong> I was talking to some of our developers, and I asked them — I often do — 'Where'd you come from?' And they come from the gaming industry, not the gambling industry, the gaming industry.</p><p><strong>Najarian:</strong> Fortnite, yes.</p><p><strong>Smith:</strong> Yes. And I said what attracted you to JP Morgan Chase from gaming? They said, "Well it's so exciting. When we do something with JPMorgan, we can hit thirty, forty, fifty million customers." And there's a little bit bragging rights when you're talking to your friends and you can say you know, "Well I've worked on this component of the mobile experience." So we've had great success at attracting talent and retaining them.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The talent needed to build that vision doesn't come cheap. Smith said the company is increasingly trimming the number of call-center jobs it has in the $30,000-a-year range and instead adding "digital designers, software programmers, software engineers, artificial intelligence PhDs" at the $100,000 to $150,000 range.</p><p>"When I'm moving expense into software developers, AI engineers and so on, they're all building for the future. They're all accelerating the medium to long-term growth of the company," Smith said.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>See also:</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7xaKlmqaTmnyntc2apZydXZ%2B9rrvRoJinZZmoerG7wJyfoqaXYrGmwsSlpqmdoqh6uLTOZq6oqptivK951aKbnqddnK6usdJmo6KjlWKzsL7Tp6CtnV2Wu6V7kmmvsqRomQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
