S. finance as: William Benson Storey, President of the Atchison; Edward Julius Berwind, Manhattan holder of coal, shipping and transportation enterprises; William Chapman Potter, President of the Guaranty Trust of Manhattan; Arthur Twining Hadley, President Emeritus of Yale; Charles Steele, Morgan partner; Henry Smith Pritchett, President of the Carnegie Foundation since 1906; and Myron Charles Taylor, Chairman of U. S. Steel’s finance committee.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Their prudence is undebatable. Last week they raised the dividend rate on Atchison common shares to $10 per share and no one doubted that this rate would be maintained for many a year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe is the richest of U. S. railroads. Its assets are approximately a billion and a quarter dollars. It has 2,324,095 shares of common stock outstanding. Great institutions as well as little people own that stock. It yields them now $23,240,950 each year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And 33 years ago the road was bankrupt, made so by the panic of 1893. A foreclosure sale wiped out hobbling debts; a new management revitalized it. Someone with good persuasive powers brought the late Edward Payson Ripley (1845-1920), to be its president. Ever since, the Atchison has paid its preferred dividends. Common dividends began in 1901, with $3.50. They changed successively to $4 $4.50, $6, $5, $5.50, $6, then (3 years ago) $7. For more than a year there have been extra $3 dividends on the common stock. That extra—fruit of “Old Man” Ripley’s tillage, of present President William Benson Storey’s cultivation—the Atchison directors by their action last week regularized.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ucG9na4FwrtSsoKedo6h6osDCoaCsp56oenJ8jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
