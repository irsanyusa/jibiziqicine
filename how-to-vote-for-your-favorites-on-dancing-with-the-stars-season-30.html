There will be no elimination in the first episode, and the vote will be open until 5 a.m. ET on Tuesday, September 21. These votes, plus the judges’ scores, will be combined with next week’s results to determine which couples will move on.</p><p>For the rest of the season, <a href=#>voting will be open</a> during the episode, closing during the last commercial break of the live broadcast, after the last couple dances. An elimination will take place at the end of the same episode, rather than carrying over into the next week.</p><p>There are two ways to vote for your favorites this season on Dancing with the Stars. First, you can go to <a href=#>ABC.com</a> and cast your vote. You’ll be able to move your votes around via this method until the voting window closes. Hit “Save Votes” each time you change things.</p><p>You can also vote via text message, with each text equaling one vote. To cast a vote for your favorite star, simply text their keyword (for most stars, this is their first name) to 21523. Check out the <a href=#>voting FAQs</a> for a list of keywords to use when sending your texts this season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CUCMlHtr-K7/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>MEET THE CELEBRITY CAST OF ‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’ SEASON 30</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-many-times-can-you-vote-per-episode>How Many Times Can You Vote Per Episode?</h3><p>When casting your votes this season, you’ll be limited to 10 votes couple, per voting method. If you use both the website and texting, that means you can vote 20 times per couple. Remember that you must be 18 years old and in the United States or Puerto Rico in order to vote.</p><p>When voting via text, message and data rates apply. If you want to vote on the ABC website, you’ll need to sign up for an account using your email address. You and your family members can vote on the same device as long as you log out of your account before the next person.</p><p>Aside from the premiere, voting will only be open during the live broadcast in the ET/CT time zones. However, you can vote during this time no matter what time zone you’re in. You can also vote for as many couples as you want.</p><p>Tune in to the Dancing with the Stars Season 30 premiere at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-20-at-12.39.jpg alt="Ariana Grande Admits She Has ‘Broken Every Rule’ in Her ‘The Voice’ Contract" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuZqyfYsOwwMRmnaiqXa68tr6Mn5ivp6Kewaa%2FjKilZpyRo7CqusZmrqKsmGLBqbGMrKuaqqNiwKat0qilZmtgZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
