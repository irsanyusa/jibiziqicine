While some parents believe it’s good for a&nbsp;kid to&nbsp;stick their head down and just get their tasks done, there’re other parents who insist on&nbsp;giving their kids some time off after long hours at&nbsp;school. One mum has admitted she does her kids’ homework for them, so&nbsp;they don’t get stressed, and provoked an&nbsp;avalanche of&nbsp;criticism from other parents.</p><p><h2>Lottie took to&nbsp;TikTok with a&nbsp;revelation addressed to&nbsp;parents.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c96/0bf/48dabc51919fdc35e2077f0343.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b67/213/06cbd3529eb899403fd4985d91.jpg><p>The US&nbsp;mum, Lottie Weaver, took to&nbsp;a&nbsp;social network with a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> that was full of&nbsp;parenting revelations. The woman shared with all her subscribers a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;controversial things she and her husband do&nbsp;while being parents to&nbsp;their kids.</p><p>The mom told about prioritizing her relationship with her spouse and called it&nbsp;“having the most honest relationship” with her kids. She listed a&nbsp;handful of&nbsp;things she does as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mum that some other parents may totally disagree with.</p><p><h2>Mom’s opinion about homework was the keynote of&nbsp;her message.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe3/1ff/9c3d9b5ed38f5278337f208ff6.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/588/3b0/8f8c2c5b5c9051b47e93b1f129.jpg><p>Lottie has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>three</a> daughters, who’re in&nbsp;Year&nbsp;5, Year&nbsp;3, and kindergarten. Lottie explained her opinion that the huge additional pressure to&nbsp;complete homework is&nbsp;“not worth&nbsp;it”, and sparked a&nbsp;furious debate.</p><p>Her kids take part in&nbsp;many after-school activities like cheerleading and sports, and they often come back home from school very tired. The woman highlighted that, instead of&nbsp;making them doing their homework, she would just do&nbsp;it&nbsp;herself. She explained this parenting decision by&nbsp;her wish to&nbsp;help them avoid stress over math’s problems they don’t have time to&nbsp;do. She admitted that she felt some people would call it&nbsp;wrong, but she said she doesn’t care and would still do&nbsp;this for her kids.</p><p><h2>Lottie explained why she chose this uncommon parenting approach.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0d/426/4a71a154d39c9ad78690dce2dc.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/398/096/f74d5e5e5ca27f757576882c75.jpg><p>Lottie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that besides the time pressure, there was another reason she would help her kids out. She said that some of&nbsp;her daughters’ projects were too difficult. <strong>“Some of&nbsp;these projects these teachers give ... I&nbsp;mean, the kids are seven years old,”</strong> she said.</p><p>Lottie added that despite doing the homework for her kids, she is&nbsp;eager to&nbsp;raise her kids to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest and strong. She admitted trying not to&nbsp;baby them when they fall and expressed the wish to&nbsp;raise them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;strong personalities.</p><p><h2>The mom received tons of&nbsp;critical comments from other parents.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/488/3a5/c717d85f8da24372f22b07f2e4.jpg><p>Many users <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>supported</a> the mom’s opinion that children shouldn’t be&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;do&nbsp;their homework after school. One person said they were even so&nbsp;glad they weren’t the only one who does their kids’ homework when they have other things going&nbsp;on. Another user praised Lottie for an&nbsp;amazing parenting style and added they’d aspire to&nbsp;try it&nbsp;when they become a&nbsp;parent.</p><p>But the majority of&nbsp;users started slamming Lottie for inappropriate parenting, blaming her of&nbsp;raising entitled and lazy kids. Others said that no-homework philosophy worked for them best, praising their kids’ schools for not assigning homework to&nbsp;them at&nbsp;all.</p><p>And here’re some parenting hacks from a&nbsp;celebrity <a href=#>Kristen Bell</a> that you might consider unconventional, but might as&nbsp;well want to&nbsp;try yourself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZusM5mpLJlm56xtHnHqKSer5%2BnuG6yzqtkraCVonq0u4ytn56xXZm8r8CMoJytZaOpv6a%2F0p6bZqiVpL2tsYycmKWkXaKybq2Mm5idZZ2kum6EkG5ucmhf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
