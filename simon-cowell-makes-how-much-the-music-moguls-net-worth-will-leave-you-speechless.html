But with great wealth comes… questions about it. How does Cowell actually make his money? What does he do with all of it?</strong></p><p>Cowell <a href=#>reportedly</a> began working in the entertainment industry when working on Stanley Kubrick’s horror film, The Shining. Cowell’s first “Hollywood” gig was cleaning the infamous axe. His father then managed to get him a job in the mail room at <a href=#>EMI Music Publishing</a>. Cowell apparently failed to get a promotion, left the company, then went back in the 1980s. Eventually he left EMI and formed Fanfare Records. It did well for a while, then failed entirely, so he went to work for BMG and that’s where he made his first million.</p><p>Cowell was given a judging role on Pop Idol in 2001 before becoming one of the first judges of American Idol in 2002. After Cowell was well known as a TV judge, he created the X Factor and America’s Got Talent based off of similar show successes in other countries. It was all uphill from there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BD0jVn_ptS8/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-how-much-does-cowell-make>So How Much Does Cowell Make?</h2><p>According to multiple sources, Cowell’s net worth is $600 million and he brings in $95 million annually. What do you even spend your earnings on if you’re making that much? There’s no way we can know for sure, but we do know that Cowell has <a href=#>two mansions</a>. One in England, and another in Malibu.</p><p>His England home is apparently worth £15 million, that’s $20 million U.S. dollars. He reportedly purchased this home <a href=#>in 2019</a>. His <a href=#>Malibu home</a> cost $24 million dollars, it also happens to be the same home where Cowell tested his <a href=#>electronic bike</a> at last year and filmed the <a href=#>America’s Got Talent judge cuts</a> during this season.</p><p>Cowell also spends a huge portion of his income on vehicles. As of 2020, Cowell’s car collection includes <a href=#>19 different cars</a>. The top three most expensive he owns are a Jaguar Eagle Speedster, a Ferrari 458 Italia, and an AC Cobra MK IV, totaling over an estimated $1 million alone.</p><p>On top of spending his wealth, Cowell also donates a lot of his money to charity. He <a href=#>reportedly</a> has close ties with Children’s Hospices UK, The Katie Piper Foundation, Battersea Dogs Home, The RSPCA, GOSH – Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital, and PETA.</p><p>It’s great to see people who have a lot donating part of what they have to a greater good. Although Simon Cowell is known as the television industry’s favorite a**hole, he’s not completely like that when it comes to his money.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BEd0QOfJtWc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/itv.jpeg alt="What is ‘Britain’s Got Talent’ Finalist Steve Royle Up to Now?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZKaZm5rAbrTOsGSmrZOderW0xGakrquZmHquu8auo6xlnprBbsPOq6uhZaeeua15y56Yr51drry2edKpnJ6bmKGytL%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
