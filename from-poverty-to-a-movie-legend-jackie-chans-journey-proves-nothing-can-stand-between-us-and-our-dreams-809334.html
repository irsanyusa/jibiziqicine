But Jackie Chan faced and overcame <a href=# title=poverty data-link=tag>poverty</a>, being left in&nbsp;Hong Kong without his parents, and following a&nbsp;strict training regimen to&nbsp;become the man he&nbsp;is&nbsp;today. He&nbsp;learned strength and discipline through his tough training which helped him get to&nbsp;where he&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;his career. This is&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;the movie icon and legend’s journey which is&nbsp;incredibly inspiring.</p><p><h2>Martial arts has been a&nbsp;big part of&nbsp;his life since he&nbsp;was young.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/055/9ca/2b2cb35fac85a8f07582713908.jpg><p>Jackie Chan was born in&nbsp;Hong Kong in&nbsp;1954. His parents were struggling to&nbsp;pay the doctor who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>delivered</a> Chan and had to&nbsp;borrow money from their friends. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;young boy, Chan would wake up&nbsp;early to&nbsp;practice kung fu&nbsp;with his father. His father took a&nbsp;job in&nbsp;Australia and Jackie stayed in&nbsp;Hong Kong at&nbsp;the China Drama Academy. Over the next decade, he&nbsp;rarely saw his parents.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;practiced martial arts all day.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66a/f75/055485505f8ca74d78abfce941.jpg><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, Chan describes his experience at&nbsp;his school. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;enrolled in&nbsp;the school when he&nbsp;was 6&nbsp;years old and would wake up&nbsp;every day at&nbsp;5&nbsp;a.m. Then he&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;run holding 2&nbsp;cups of&nbsp;water and not spill any. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;did, the teachers would punish him. He&nbsp;would then have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;handstand for 1&nbsp;hour followed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;martial arts routine. The teachers would make him stop in&nbsp;a&nbsp;difficult position and hold it&nbsp;for 20&nbsp;minutes.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;moved into stunt work.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e06/a46/397acb5d1a9f381abf089a0e7e.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;17, Chan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>graduated</a> and had to&nbsp;find work, which proved difficult as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was never taught to&nbsp;read and write. So&nbsp;manual labor or&nbsp;stunt work was all that was really available for him. Chan was very athletic, inventive, and fearless. He&nbsp;tried everything and became very in&nbsp;demand. But the Hong Kong movie scene started to&nbsp;dry up&nbsp;and he&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;Australia to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with his parents. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, he&nbsp;describes the time when he&nbsp;worked with Bruce Lee and the actor accidentally hit him. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “It&nbsp;was so&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hit by&nbsp;Bruce Lee.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e75/60d/d9c8305c64b00bd86caa58087f.jpg><p>He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked</a> in&nbsp;construction and in&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant but wasn’t happy. In&nbsp;1976, he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;telegram from Willie Chan that changed his life. He&nbsp;wanted him to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;the film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>New Fist of&nbsp;Fury</i></a><i>. </i>He&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;do&nbsp;his own death-defying stunts. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, he&nbsp;spoke about his hardest stunt in&nbsp;the film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Project A</i></a>. Chan fell from a&nbsp;clock tower. The actor said it&nbsp;took 7&nbsp;days to&nbsp;nail the stunt, but he&nbsp;fell on&nbsp;his head and it&nbsp;caused him aches for 2&nbsp;years.</p><p><h2>Becoming the beloved and highly successful actor he&nbsp;is&nbsp;today.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/96e/70a/80a0c5550a83072ecfaaf2358e.jpg><p>Chan became a&nbsp;huge success in&nbsp;Asia, but it&nbsp;took him a&nbsp;while to&nbsp;break out in&nbsp;America. It&nbsp;wasn’t until his film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Rumble in&nbsp;the Bronx</i></a>, was a&nbsp;huge hit that Jackie was considered a&nbsp;star in&nbsp;America. From there, he&nbsp;went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;make many more blockbusters, including <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Rush Hour</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Shanghai Noon</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Karate Kid</i></a>. In&nbsp;2016, Chan was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>awarded</a> an&nbsp;honorary Academy Award for his exceptional contribution to&nbsp;motion pictures. Chan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “Standing here is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream. After 56&nbsp;years in&nbsp;the film industry, making more than 200&nbsp;films, breaking so&nbsp;many bones, finally, this is&nbsp;mine.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;well-loved by&nbsp;his co-stars.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e5/2b4/2b5afe51fdbbda9009df934172.jpg><p>The 2&nbsp;action legends worked together in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Iron Mask</i></a>. When they bumped into each other, they shared the picture above on&nbsp;their social media pages.

In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, he&nbsp;spoke about working with Chan on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Rush Hour</i></a>. He&nbsp;said they both felt like outsiders in&nbsp;Hollywood and felt very comfortable around each other and messing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;each other. There was no&nbsp;ego involved. He&nbsp;said, “Jackie didn’t care. He’d be&nbsp;like, ’Be funny. Help this movie work.’”</p><p>Chan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spends</a> a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time working with charities. He&nbsp;takes his role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;UNICEF <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ambassador</a> very seriously and in&nbsp;his spare time works relentlessly for children, those in&nbsp;need, and the elderly.</p><p>Are you inspired by&nbsp;Jackie Chan’s story?
