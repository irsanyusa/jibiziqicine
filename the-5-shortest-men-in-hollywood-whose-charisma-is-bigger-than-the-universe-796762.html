They are true <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> celebrities thanks to&nbsp;their talent and their enormous virtue of&nbsp;not giving&nbsp;up. They have starred in&nbsp;films and have undertaken solidarity projects, showing&nbsp;us that being a&nbsp;star is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;centimeters, but of&nbsp;charisma.</p><p>Here, at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;are delighted to&nbsp;share their success stories in&nbsp;the film industry with our readers.</p><p><h2>1. Danny DeVito, 4’10″ (147&nbsp;cm)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/404/d8f/539d5c526cb1d5b0d1da0bde42.jpg><p>His short stature, due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare <a href=#>genetic disorder</a>, did not prevent him from chasing his dream. He&nbsp;went to&nbsp;acting school in&nbsp;New York in&nbsp;the 60s, where he&nbsp;struck up&nbsp;a&nbsp;great friendship with <a href=# title="Michael Douglas" data-link=tag>Michael Douglas</a> which continues through today. Danny DeVito has participated in&nbsp;dozens of&nbsp;movies and series since the 70s. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;great recognition of&nbsp;his career, in&nbsp;2011, DeVito received a&nbsp;<a href=#>star</a> on&nbsp;the Hollywood Walk of&nbsp;Fame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef1/7d6/25a73f5a85a98ff522789059f8.jpg><p>He’s not only developed a&nbsp;career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor, but also has become a&nbsp;major film and television <a href=#>producer</a>, and continues to&nbsp;grow in&nbsp;his prolific career. Without going further, his last film appearance was in&nbsp;<a href=#>Dumbo</a> in&nbsp;2019. He’s married to&nbsp;actress Rhea Perlman, whom he&nbsp;<a href=#>met</a> in&nbsp;the series Taxi and with whom he&nbsp;has 3&nbsp;children and a&nbsp;lovely story of&nbsp;endless love.</p><p><h2>2. Peter Dinklage, 4’5″ (135&nbsp;cm)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/825/052/0c5fd457b1b5a42c588188bb31.jpg><p>He&nbsp;was born with achondroplasia, a&nbsp;common form of&nbsp;dwarfism. A&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;act ran through his veins since childhood, as&nbsp;Dinklage and his brother <a href=#>performed</a> puppet musicals for people in&nbsp;their neighborhood. He&nbsp;<a href=#>struggled</a> to&nbsp;find work as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor, partially because he&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;take the roles typically offered to&nbsp;actors with his condition, such as&nbsp;“elves or&nbsp;leprechauns.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b81/4c4/617e5e5970a3bbe1e72409f41f.jpg><p>A&nbsp;long-distance race that paid off when he&nbsp;became one of&nbsp;the protagonists of&nbsp;<a href=#>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</a>. In&nbsp;2012 Dinklage <a href=#>won</a> the award for Best Supporting Actor for this role. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;happily <a href=#>married</a> to&nbsp;Erica Schmidt, a&nbsp;theater director with whom he&nbsp;has 2&nbsp;children.</p><p><h2>3. Tony Cox, 3’6″ (106.68&nbsp;cm)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3df/818/cb32e05e96b302791904f3cdf1.jpg><p>Encouraged by&nbsp;relatives and friends, he&nbsp;<a href=#>moved</a> to&nbsp;Los Angeles at&nbsp;age 18&nbsp;to&nbsp;try his luck in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;acting. He&nbsp;began taking classes at&nbsp;the Merrick Studio School of&nbsp;Acting and soon began working in&nbsp;commercial, film, and television roles. He&nbsp;<a href=# title=got data-link=tag>got</a> secondary roles, until his great moment came with a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;<a href=#>Me&nbsp;Myself &&nbsp;Irene</a>, where Cox played a&nbsp;memorable role and starred on&nbsp;screen with world-famous stars like <a href=# title="Jim Carrey" data-link=tag>Jim Carrey</a> and Renee Zellweger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c9/587/c0b9c755108ec99218b9a376ac.jpg><p>Cox has broken stereotypes, as&nbsp;his role in&nbsp;<a href=#>Bad Santa</a> was the rare occurrence of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dwarf actor in&nbsp;a&nbsp;leading role. He&nbsp;<a href=#>met</a> his future wife, Otelia, during high school. They were eventually married in&nbsp;1981 when Cox was 23&nbsp;years old and they’re still together today.</p><p><h2>4. Warwick Ashley Davis, 3’6″ (107&nbsp;cm)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a1/3d7/1a4b015367a18b347ccd3662e2.jpg><p>When Davis was&nbsp;11, his <a href=#>grandmother</a> heard a&nbsp;radio advertisement calling for people who were 4&nbsp;feet (1.2&nbsp;m) tall or&nbsp;shorter to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;Return of&nbsp;the Jedi. To&nbsp;Davis, who was a&nbsp;<a href=#>fan</a> of&nbsp;the Star Wars films, being selected for the role was a&nbsp;dream come true. He&nbsp;played the role of&nbsp;Professor Filius Flitwick in&nbsp;the <a href=#>Harry Potter</a> films and lately he&nbsp;has become a&nbsp;television presenter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42c/f70/fee81057d3a7e5ba949e9836b9.jpg><p>Beyond his acting career, in&nbsp;1995, Davis co-founded, with fellow dwarf actor and father-in-law Peter Burroughs, the talent agency <a href=#>Willow Management,</a> which specializes in&nbsp;representing actors under 5′ (1.52&nbsp;m) tall. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the co-founder of&nbsp;<a href=#>Little People&nbsp;UK</a>, a&nbsp;charity that provides support to&nbsp;people with dwarfism and their families. He&nbsp;married Samantha <a href=#>Burroughs</a> in&nbsp;1991, with whom he&nbsp;has 3&nbsp;lovely children who accompany them on&nbsp;the red carpet to&nbsp;their premieres.</p><p><h2>5. Verne Troyer, 2’8″ (81&nbsp;cm)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/244/7d6/db274452dfbb3c41eb0f9ce5d9.jpg><p>His most iconic role, Mini-Me, led him to&nbsp;stardom. The co-creator of&nbsp;the <a href=#>Austin Powers</a> films, Myers, was so&nbsp;impressed with Troyer’s performance that he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;<a href=#>rewrite</a> the script for the next release to&nbsp;give Mini-Me more screen time and remove the character’s death. He’s also made several appearances as&nbsp;himself in&nbsp;<a href=#>reality</a> television series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c5/6e7/f5f25a5a13a101c80dc140065c.jpg><p>He&nbsp;shared his life with Brittney Powell <a href=#>from</a> 2007 until Troyer tragically <a href=#>died</a> in&nbsp;2018. Even though his stature was small and his parents <a href=#>often wondered</a> if&nbsp;he’d be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;reach up&nbsp;and open doors on&nbsp;his own in&nbsp;his life, he&nbsp;went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;open more doors for himself and others than anyone could have imagined.</p><p>Don’t you think these actors have inspired people with their determination and attitude? Which of&nbsp;their film appearances did you like the most?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYxuZKygn6fBpr%2FTZqSepl2eu260zqWjsq%2BfpLFuw8eoqp5lk52us7XSpphmoaNir6qzxp6pZqyYlrtuwMeeZK6mmauys7%2FEZm5ybmdrf3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
