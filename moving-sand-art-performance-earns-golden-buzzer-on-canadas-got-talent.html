During the show, host Lindsay Ell hit the Golden Buzzer for a moving mother-daughter sand art duo.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lindsay-ell-hits-canada-s-got-talent-golden-buzzer>Lindsay Ell Hits Canada’s Got Talent Golden Buzzer</h2><p>During Tuesday’s show, a mother-daughter duo called Together for Peace took the stage and revealed that they left everything behind in Ukraine to escape the war. They went on to share a sand art performance that told their moving story.</p><p>The judges were emotional as they watched the performance, and CGT host Lindsay Ell could be seen tearing up as she watched from backstage. Trish Stratus called it a “beautiful and unique way to convey a message.”</p><p>After the judges shared their thoughts, Ell stepped out from backstage, saying she was “a mess right now.” As she said, “There’s so much hate and distress in the world right now, and it’s really inspiring watching a mother and daughter come together, and feeling their strength.”</p><p>Ell hit the Golden Buzzer for the duo, sending them straight into the next round. They’ll also receive $25,000, courtesy of CIBC.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TIKTOK SINGER DISCOVERED BY LILLY SINGH AUDITIONS FOR ‘CANADA’S GOT TALENT’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Another standout audition from Tuesday night’s show came from standup comedian Ashwyn Singh, who joked about becoming a Canadian permanent resident. Ashwyn, who is originally from India, had to take a test of English as a foreign language after he graduated from the University of Waterloo.</p><p>“The Canadian government was like, ‘Yes, we know you have a degree from one of our universities, but do you speak English?'” Ashwyn said, prompting laughs from the judges and audience. “The other day, a dude said to me, ‘Your English is really good.’ And I could tell that he was spelling ‘your’ wrong. He did not spell it out. I just heard the apostrophe.”</p><p>The judges gave Ashwyn a standing ovation. Lilly Singh told him, “You have just made me so incredibly proud to be a judge on this show.” All four of them voted yes to sending him through to the next round.</p><p>What did you think of this week’s performances on Canada’s Got Talent?
