The thriving online niche has amassed major traction, with fans eagerly anticipating blogger Caitlin Covington, better known as <a href=#>“Christian Girl Autumn,”</a> posting photos from<strong> </strong>her annual fall Vermont photo shoot and hashtags like #autumnaesthetic and #fallaestetic collectively gaining over over 7 billion views on TikTok.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I want to create stuff that emulates the feeling of fall and coziness and just brings people some comfort in everyday life,” Pounds tells TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fall has been Pounds’ favorite season since she was a child in Ohio. Now, after previously having given up<strong> </strong>on trying to earn a following with <a href=#>flat-lay content</a>,<strong> </strong>pivoting to cozy seasonal videos has enabled her to gain 100,000 TikTok followers and leave her job in the hospitality industry to do content creation full time. All it took was a simple fall-aesthetic video going viral on <a href=#>Instagram Reels</a>. The video, in which she is simply sitting in a car, reading a book with tea and a blanket while rain falls outside the windows, racked up over 1 million views in a single day. The internet and its fall enthusiasts have played a big role in the commodification of the season: <a href=#>According to Fortune</a>, <a href=#>NielsenIQ data</a> shows that the pumpkin spice market produced more than $800 million from July 2022 to July 2023.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And as much as Pounds is entering the prime months for viewers eager to immerse themselves in the pumpkins and changing leaves featured in her current videos, the North Carolina-based creator doesn’t just post cozy content within the three-month bracket of the season. She’s realized that the internet is interested in cozy content year-round. “I'm really good at emulating that autumn feeling even if it's like 90 degrees outside,” she says.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The history of fall content on the internet&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fall obsession itself is nothing new. Many beloved films and TV shows are memorable for their crunching leaves and ties to the season (think: When Harry Met Sally; Good Will Hunting; Silver Lining Playbook). And the internet’s love of foliage content<strong> </strong>started long before the emergence of TikTok and vertical videos.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Covington remembers first coming across the content on the websites Pinterest and We Heart It. Pounds’ obsession started as early as 2011<strong> </strong>on sites like Tumblr. “Consuming other people’s content gave me a really warm feeling in my chest,” she says. Images related to fall eventually manifested on platforms like Instagram, with influencers and their followers using “<a href=#>fall presets</a>” and filter apps like VSCO whose colors imbued their images with the feeling of fall year round.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of the most significant contributions to fall content on the internet came from lifestyle YouTubers. A pioneer in the space was influencer Bethany Mota (known to the chronically online as MacBarbie07). With nearly 10 million YouTube subscribers, Mota was the face of the video platform from the early to mid-2010s<strong> </strong>thanks to her seasonal content. Her second most-watched video (17 million views and still counting) was a <a href=#>morning fall routine video</a> in which she makes herself tea, puts on plum-hued makeup and dresses in a thick cardigan sweater before heading out to Starbucks for a pumpkin spice frappuccino.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ten years since the video was uploaded, it’s still receiving thousands of new comments from viewers saying that they return to it for its cozy, fall nostalgia. Just last month a TikToker by the username <a href=#>@Gingeraleprincess99</a> uploaded a video with over 700,000 views pegged<strong> </strong>to the return of Starbucks’ pumpkin spice latte and was sure to include Mota’s famous get-ready-with-me video. She goes on to say that Mota’s cultural impact on the internet’s obsession with fall vibes has reverberated throughout time, calling the YouTuber’s casual sipping of the Starbucks drink the “fall vibes big bang theory.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The phenomenon of “Christian Girl Autumn”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fast forward to the present, and the reigning queen of fall content is Covington. Her dominance is thanks, in part, to her understanding that people look to her for fall content even during the long days of summer, as they dream ahead to cooler temperatures. With this in mind, she starts rolling out content <a href=#>as early as mid-July</a>, sporadically posting a<a href=#> fall-themed video</a> or <a href=#>outfit post</a>, seemingly building hype for the main event:<strong> </strong>her yearly fall-themed photos. These pictures led to the creation of the meme “Christian Girl Autumn,” which she has embraced; even if it’s sometimes couched in a derisive tone, it has no doubt increased the amount of attention she receives on social media<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The meme satirizes a certain type of content that (primarily white) women who are obsessed with autumn post on social media: wide brimmed hats, tall neutral colored riding boots, impeccably curled silken hair, and a cozy cardigan all set against a backdrop of peak fall foliage. In 2019, Covington became the unofficial face of the meme and her content–much like the annual Jason Derulo falling down the Met steps meme that returns every May–has become a constant fixture in the unofficial yearly meme calendar.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The 33-year-old content creator has maintained her blog, <a href=#>Southern Curls & Pearls</a>, since 2011. On it, <a href=#>she posts recipes as well as outfit photos with links</a> to the pieces as well as lists of her favorite lifestyle and beauty products that can be purchased through affiliate links. Covington tells TIME that she noticed people’s fascination with fall content early on, somewhere around 2013 or 2014, especially when she posted photos of the fall foliage. She says she would drive around her hometown trying to find the most picturesque leaves. “There was a very clear distinction in engagement when I was standing next to a beautiful fall tree, or there were fall leaves on the ground,” Covington says. “So it became a thing where, every fall, I would try to find the best.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For the past nine years, she has been venturing outside of North Carolina for the perfect fall scenery, including road-tripping to Vermont with her brother, an employee of her company. Her yearly pilgrimage to the Northeast has become an anticipated viral moment, akin to discussions around exactly when is the appropriate time to start listening to Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” in the run-up to the holiday season. The pop culture news account <a href=#>@popcrave</a> recently posted an announcement on X that she was heading to Vermont soon to take her photos, and the tweet received over 120,000 likes and over 12,000 retweets. One user on X quoted the post with a video of a motorcade with the caption that reads, “Caitlin Covington arriving in Vermont.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Covington says she’s currently ordering outfits in anticipation of heading to Vermont in mid-October with her family for this year’s fall photoshoot. “I'm just already envisioning having a cup of coffee, it being chilly and fall leaves everywhere,” she says. “I am so excited about it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The craze for perfect fall content hasn’t been welcomed by all. Other influencers have emulated Covington’s fall aesthetic by making their own journeys to picturesque towns. <a href=#>The Boston Globe recently reported</a> that the Vermont town of Pomfret has been overwhelmed with visitors attempting to take pictures. The number of content creators has led to an increase of traffic from tour buses and cars, with reports of people trespassing on private property, littering, and urinating in bushes. This has led the town to bar tourists from one of its most photogenic roads between Sept. 23 and Oct. 15.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why fall content resonates with audiences&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The appeal of fall is multifaceted, but for Pounds and Covington, it all boils down to a sense of inherent comfort that radiates through the screen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I know for myself, I deal with a lot of anxiety, and life is stressful and so busy,” says Covington. “I think fall is all about embracing moments of comfort, whether a hot coffee, a really soft cardigan, or a new book. Everybody can relate to that.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pounds adds that fall also reminds people of their childhoods. “It reminds them of going back to school and those happy memories that we connected with as a child,” she tells TIME. “It allows us to kind of live through that energy that we had when we were younger because it was always so exciting.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There is a psychological element viewers are potentially experiencing when consuming the neutral tones of the fall aesthetic. “Colors that are very low in saturation, not bright and and not vibrant are typically seen as being very soothing, therefore it can also soothe our emotions,” says Karen Haller, a color psychology specialist and author of The Little Book of Colour.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The world does this crazy thing where all the leaves turn from green to these beautiful vibrant colors,” says Covington. “I think everyone, no matter who you are, can appreciate the beauty in that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2FrgnOAjp%2BYpaRdlrK0wMeeq6Kbo2LBqrfTqKJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
