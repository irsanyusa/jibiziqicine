They’re especially likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;judged negatively if&nbsp;they’re also attractive, <a href=#>says</a> Bernie Carducci, a&nbsp;psychologist at&nbsp;Indiana University.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>are taking a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the reasons why our shyness can make people think we’re aloof and are sharing the stories of&nbsp;people who are in&nbsp;the same boat.</p><p><h2>Being bashful can make&nbsp;us appear like snobs.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;feel shy, we&nbsp;tend not to&nbsp;talk much. But <strong>when we’re quiet, it’s hard for people to&nbsp;know what we&nbsp;think.</strong> There’s even a&nbsp;phrase: “It’s the quiet ones you have to&nbsp;watch,” as&nbsp;if&nbsp;we’re quiet because we’re hiding something. Some people who are more outgoing have <a href=#>mentioned</a> that they find quiet people intimidating because they think they’re unpredictable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/424/619/1dd5c2557dad4154b17d764c9e.jpg><p><strong>Being socially anxious can affect our <a href=#>body language</a></strong> as&nbsp;well, which can give off the impression of&nbsp;being stuck&nbsp;up. And it&nbsp;doesn’t help if&nbsp;you have naturally “unfriendly” facial features. It’s even worse if&nbsp;you’re also an&nbsp;introvert, which means you need time to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;your own or&nbsp;you’ll burn out. Choosing not to&nbsp;hang out with others can make you seem standoffish.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/41f/364/5f57fe5a5197c64de37fc6b155.jpg><p><strong>Usually, when we&nbsp;do&nbsp;something that people don’t expect or&nbsp;don’t do&nbsp;something that people do&nbsp;expect, they feel the need to&nbsp;make up&nbsp;a&nbsp;reason for&nbsp;it.</strong> So&nbsp;when we&nbsp;act differently around them than when we’re with people we’re close&nbsp;to, they might feel as&nbsp;if&nbsp;we&nbsp;think they’re not good enough for&nbsp;us. In&nbsp;our eyes, we’re just being nervous, but in&nbsp;their eyes, we’re being mean for acting like we’re “<a href=#>too good</a>” for them.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;happens to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;us.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=# title="high school" data-link=tag>high school</a>, a&nbsp;popular girl said to&nbsp;me, “Wow I&nbsp;thought you were cold, but you’re actually really sweet.” I&nbsp;was the most innocent shy dork, I&nbsp;just wore a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;black eyeshadow. —&nbsp;<a href=#>TheLadyButtPimple/reddit</a></p><p>The first thing a&nbsp;coworker said to&nbsp;me, about 4&nbsp;months into working together, was, “Why are you so&nbsp;mean?” Like, I&nbsp;don’t even talk, how am&nbsp;I&nbsp;mean? —&nbsp;<a href=#>wish-i-was-a-dalek/reddit</a></p><p>I’m shy and&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;facial tick that makes it&nbsp;look like I’m raising my&nbsp;eyebrows or&nbsp;rolling my&nbsp;eyes at&nbsp;people. I&nbsp;get a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of: “I&nbsp;thought you were arrogant but then&nbsp;I just realized there’s probably something wrong with you.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>rabbitwarriorreturns/reddit</a></p><p>I&nbsp;get told they thought&nbsp;I hated them. I&nbsp;really have no&nbsp;idea what I&nbsp;do to&nbsp;make them perceive that. I&nbsp;always try my&nbsp;hardest to&nbsp;be&nbsp;welcoming, work on&nbsp;my&nbsp;tone of&nbsp;voice, and ask people questions about themselves. I’m just not a&nbsp;very smiley person, so&nbsp;I guess it&nbsp;probably has to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with that body language. —&nbsp;<a href=#>goldbricker83/reddit</a></p><p><h2>Even celebrities face the same problem.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c44/51a/9e14ac51419f76ebdb0cd9be45.jpg><p><a href=# title=Zendaya data-link=tag>Zendaya</a> <a href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about still trying to&nbsp;overcome her childhood shyness, especially as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress. Her stylist once mentioned to&nbsp;her that she comes off kind of&nbsp;cold and that people think she’s mean because she doesn’t talk. But the truth is&nbsp;that she was just too nervous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7e/a22/bcf3b352caa8e2070480c51fc8.jpg><p><a href=# title=Rihanna data-link=tag>Rihanna</a> <a href=#>said</a> that the biggest misconception about her is&nbsp;that people don’t know she’s shy. She admitted that she kind of&nbsp;pretends that it’s not happening so&nbsp;people think she’s confident. But actually, she’s so&nbsp;shy that she doesn’t want people to&nbsp;know that she’s shy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f3/8d7/85c70c5daf8b5c0d37af1e2541.jpg><p>Zayn Malik <a href=#>confessed</a> that he’s not a&nbsp;very outgoing social person. Even though he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;bad boy <a href=#>reputation</a>, he’s really an&nbsp;introvert who battles with anxiety. He&nbsp;doesn’t mind being described as&nbsp;“misunderstood.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3f/e8d/e23e4f54cb9ca94b42e1e40def.jpg><p>People always <a href=#>tell</a> <a href=# title="Bella Hadid" data-link=tag>Bella Hadid</a> that she seems mean or&nbsp;intimidating on&nbsp;social media and that she’s so&nbsp;different than what they expected. She said that she loves engaging with new people and only feels uncomfortable in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the camera.</p><p><h2>But there are ways to&nbsp;avoid being misunderstood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf8/5fa/250f19540fb28066fb033d0ddc.jpg><p>Since being reserved could make&nbsp;us appear like ice queens and kings, perhaps we&nbsp;could try to&nbsp;sound modest by&nbsp;<strong>complimenting other people</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>steering the conversation</strong> to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;people who like to&nbsp;talk instead. Whenever speaking is&nbsp;hard, you can try to&nbsp;<strong>talk with your face and body</strong> by&nbsp;smiling, nodding, shrugging, etc. However, if&nbsp;some people still misunderstand you despite all this extra effort, maybe it’s time to&nbsp;move&nbsp;on. Sometimes it’s better to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;arrogant than to&nbsp;be&nbsp;someone you’re not.</p><p>Have you ever had anyone tell you that you seem cold? What did you do&nbsp;to&nbsp;make others understand you better?</p><p>From selling clothes on&nbsp;the streets of&nbsp;Barbados to&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;nine-time Grammy winner, <a href=#>Rihanna</a>’s life is&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;resilience and hard work. Born into a&nbsp;modest family, the singer had a&nbsp;challenging upbringing but never let adversity deter her. Her musical talent was discovered at&nbsp;15, and she quickly rose to&nbsp;global stardom. Now a&nbsp;billionaire focusing on&nbsp;her business ventures and motherhood, Rihanna is&nbsp;planning a&nbsp;musical comeback.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ybnKKml2LAqcWMnKaupJRiuqK3xGaqqKWVYr2mu8%2BlnGarlZq6brnEmqVmmaRis6q%2B0q1koKSRo7CmeZdpZ3BsaWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
