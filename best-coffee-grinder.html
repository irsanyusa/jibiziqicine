It’s not just about the caffeine either, it’s about the different types of coffee. While I do get a little pep in my step after my morning cup, it’s also simply delicious. As a daily coffee drinker, I’ve known for years that it’s more affordable to make your own coffee at home than to buy it from a coffee shop. Yet it never tasted quite as good when I did it myself. That is, until I committed to grinding my own beans. Turns out, that’s the game-changer.</p><p>Coffee grinders don’t need to be the domain of artisanal coffee shops or coffee snobs. Coming in a range of sizes and prices, coffee grinders are an accessible way to completely elevate your at-home coffee making. This is because grinding your own coffee beans lets you control the grind to your exact preferences, while keeping the coffee as fresh as possible. In fact, many industry professionals say that the grind can be more impactful than the beans themselves when it comes to the quality of the final product. With the right coffee grinder, I genuinely enjoy the ritual of brewing a coffee at home. It doesn’t take long, yet I can customize each cup to that day’s specific method of brewing and preference. It also tastes a thousand times better.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-best-coffee-grinder>Our top picks for best coffee grinder</h2><h3>Best basic coffee grinder: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Baratza Encore Coffee Grinder</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best basic coffee grinder</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Baratza Encore Coffee Grinder ZCG485BLK, Black</h3></p><p>Baratza is well-known among the coffee community for making high quality products and the Encore Coffee Grinder is no exception, despite being a more basic model. In fact, the Encore is a perfect entry-point for coffee lovers and even a good long-term choice, thanks to its ease of use, small footprint and great versatility. The compact design means it won’t take up too much space on your countertop, yet there is no compromise on performance. This burr grinder offers 40 different settings, allowing you to get exactly the right texture whether you’re making french press, drip or even espresso. While this model won’t give you quite as fine a grind as dedicated espresso grinders, industry experts repeatedly praise the Encore for its impressive range. I especially like the simple on/off button and dial setting, as well as the angled grind chamber sides which allow for neat pouring—there’s no stress or mess with this one! For most coffee drinkers, the Encore is going to be an ideal choice.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 6.3 inches (length) x 4.7inches (width) x 13.8inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Burr grinder</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Weight: 3.1 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 8 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: 40</li><li>Noise level: Loud</li><li>Price at publish: $149.14</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Affordably priced yet incredibly consistent, with Baratza’s signature high quality</li><li>40 grind settings allow you to make exactly the right adjustments to suit your taste</li><li>Easy to use, clean, disassemble and reassemble, so you can use it every day</li><li>Compact footprint makes it a good choice for any size kitchen</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not quite as quiet as some of the other options on this list</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Baratza Encore Coffee Grinder is the brand’s most affordable model, yet it packs in a ton of consistent performance and offers 40 grind settings that will cover all your coffee bases.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Baratza Encore Coffee Grinder</a></p><h3>Best budget coffee grinder: <a rel=nofollow href=#>OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best budget coffee grinder</span></p><p><h3 class=title>OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</h3></p><p>You don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars on a good coffee grinder and the OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder is a perfect example of that. At just under $100, the OXO grinder uses burrs to produce a nice range of grind types, with 15 settings to select from. While the fine setting isn’t quite good enough for really high quality espresso, I’ve still found that this model is incredibly versatile and consistent for the majority of home-brew methods. I also appreciate some of the thoughtful design details that OXO has included, such as the hopper’s UV-blocking tint which keeps beans fresh when left inside. There is also a one-touch start timer which locks in the previous grind’s settings, so you can pick up right where you left off. The stainless steel exterior looks more expensive than it is, while the overall shape is nice and compact for easy countertop storage. If you’re a bit less finicky about your coffee, then this is a great product.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 7.5 inches (depth) x 5.25 inches (width) x 12.5 inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Burr grinder</li><li>Material: Stainless steel</li><li>Weight: 2 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 12 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: 15</li><li>Noise level: Loud</li><li>Price at publish: $99.95</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Under $100 and performs like a more expensive model</li><li>Consistently produces an even grind, with 15 different settings to choose from</li><li>The one-touch start timer saves the previous grind’s settings for ease of use</li><li>The internal chamber has a UV-blocking tint, so beans stay fresh if left inside</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not quite as fine a grind as more expensive models</li><li>Not as well suited for espresso</li><li>Loud to use</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For just under $100, the OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee grinder is a great budget option that offers versatility and a nice save-setting feature, although it isn’t ideal for espresso.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</a></p><h3>Best coffee grinder with a built-in scale: <a rel=nofollow href=#>OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder with Scale</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best coffee grinder with a built-in scale</span></p><p><h3 class=title>OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder with Scale</h3></p><p>This grinder takes our beloved budget pick and upgrades it with a useful built-in scale, automatic shut-off and three measurement modes, so you can grind exactly the right amount of coffee every time. The OXO Grinder with Scale is considerably more expensive than its sister model and takes up more space too, but you get a much more convenient product for the extra cost. Using the Cups setting, you can simply select your preferred grind type and the number of cups you want to make. The grinder will automatically produce the right amount of grounds—and no more. This is ideal if you’re in a rush, particularly when combined with the automatic shut-off feature. Also, while this coffee grinder is larger than its more affordable counterpart, it still ultimately saves you kitchen space by removing the need to buy a separate scale. If you’re willing to pay a little more for convenience, this is a worthy upgrade.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 7.2 inches (length) x 11.1 inches (width) x 16.4 inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Burr grinder</li><li>Material: Stainless steel</li><li>Weight: 3 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 16 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: 38</li><li>Noise level: Loud</li><li>Price at publish: $269.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Three modes (cups, grams, manual) to suit different grinding purposes</li><li>38 different grind settings to suit a range of different brewing methods</li><li>Built-in scale saves counter space and makes it easy to grind exactly the right amount</li><li>Automatic shut-off means you can leave the device unattended, ideal for busy mornings</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Much more expensive than the other OXO grinder</li><li>Loud to run</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Upgrade your OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder with the built-in scale, for incredible convenience, additional grind settings and a useful automatic shut-off feature.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder with Scale</a></p><h3>Best coffee grinder for espresso: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Baratza Sette 270 Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best coffee grinder for espresso</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Baratza Sette 270 Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</h3></p><p>Good quality espresso requires really fine grounds that most generic coffee grinders are not able to achieve. (And you wouldn’t want to put those in one of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best espresso machines</a>.) On the flip side, dedicated espresso grinders can be prohibitively expensive. That’s why I love the Baratza Sette 270 Conical Burr Coffee Grinder. It’s not designed just for espresso, but it produces espresso grounds as if it was. Not only that, but you have access to 270 different grind settings, so you can adjust the level to exactly your preference. This is perfect for any connoisseurs who want to get really into the weeds of at-home brewing. I also really like the slim, yet angular design, which looks good on the countertop, but also lets you deposit your grinds directly into your brewer of choice. It’s the thoughtful details which really make each use a pleasure and Baratza has equipped its Sette grinder with 3 programmable presets for your favorite customized grind settings to make early mornings that much smoother. Yes, it’s much more expensive than many of my other recommendations, but you get a truly elite performance with the Sette, and genuinely good espresso.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 5.1 inches (length) x 9.4 inches (width) x 15.0 inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Burr grinder</li><li>Material: Steel</li><li>Weight: 3.2 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 14 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: 270</li><li>Noise level: Quiet</li><li>Price at publish: $399.95</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>An incredible 270 grind settings to choose from, for the most accurate results</li><li>As good at making espresso as it is at making grounds for drip, French press etc.</li><li>The ability to save three different grind settings for convenience and speed</li><li>Designed to grind directly into your brewer of choice for minimum clean-up</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>More expensive than most models on this list</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Baratza Sette Coffee Grinder is the perfect choice for high quality espresso and a strong performance, with 270 grind settings that each deliver premium results.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Baratza Sette 270 Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</a></p><h3>Most durable coffee grinder: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Eureka Mignon Filtro Silent Coffee Grinder</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Most durable coffee grinder</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Eureka Mignon Filtro Silent Coffee Grinder</h3></p><p>If you’re a coffee lover who’s willing to invest in a grinder, then chances are that you’ll be using it all the time. To make your investment truly worthwhile, look for one that will stand up to frequent use like the Eureka Mignon Filtro Silent Coffee Grinder. This model is an upgrade on Eureka’s classic Filtro design, fitted with motor and case insulation for a particularly quiet grinding experience. It also deploys 50mm burrs, which are larger than those found in most grinders and able to deliver a really powerful milling action. This results in premium quality grounds, day after day. Even the design screams durable, with its large blocky stature and clean, modern lines. This grinder performs consistently and efficiently. Fortunately, you won’t need to sacrifice finesse in exchange for longevity, as the Eureka Mignon Filtro features a stepless dial which means infinite setting options. I love that you can play around and find exactly the right grind level for your tastes.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 6.75 inches (depth) x 5.0 inches (width) x 13.75. inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Burr grinder</li><li>Material: Metal, plastic</li><li>Weight: 5.6 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 12 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: Stepless/Infinite</li><li>Noise level: Quiet</li><li>Price at publish: $269</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Larger-than-usual 50mm burrs offer powerful, consistent grinding time after time</li><li>The stepless dial for grind setting means you have an infinite number of options, to truly customize your experience</li><li>This version utilizes motor and case insulation for a supremely quiet experience</li><li>The sturdy design is also modern-looking, making it a cool addition to the countertop</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>For a more expensive model, it doesn’t offer any espresso capabilities</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>With an infinite number of grind settings, an extra quiet motor and a sturdy build that will last you years, the Eureka Mignon Filtro Silent Grinder is a worthy investment purchase.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Eureka Mignon Filtro Silent Coffee Grinder</a></p><h3>Best manual coffee grinder: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Timemore Chestnut C2 Manual Coffee Grinder</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best manual coffee grinder</span></p><p><h3 class=title>TIMEMORE Chestnut C2 Manual Coffee Grinder Capacity 25g with CNC Stainless Steel Conical Burr</h3></p><p>It may seem strange to opt for a manual coffee grinder when there are all these advanced electric options available, but a good manual option has a host of benefits, especially the Timemore Chestnut C2 Manual Coffee Grinder. This neat little grinder is ideal for anyone looking to free up countertop space, as well as for frequent travelers, as it weighs under half a kilo and fits easily in one hand. While it doesn’t feature a motor, it does utilize burr grinders for a consistent performance across 36 different grind settings. Espresso lovers won’t get as fine a grind as they need, but any other home brewing method will suit the Timemore Chestnut C2. If you regularly make coffee for just one or two cups, then this smaller grinder may actually be a more practical choice than a large countertop appliance. The Chestnut C2 is also available for under $69 and therefore suitable for those on a budget, those exploring coffee grinding for the first time or those looking to gift something thoughtful, but well-priced. Of course, a manual grinder requires you to crank the handle to get your coffee, so if you have mobility issues or simply want to press a button first thing in the morning, then this won’t be for you. I find the Timemore Chestnut C2 a compelling option that achieves great results for the lowest price.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 2.6 inches (depth) x 5.5 inches (width) x 7.5 inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Manual burr grinder</li><li>Material: Aluminum</li><li>Weight: 0.45 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 0.88 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: 36</li><li>Noise level: Very quiet</li><li>Price at publish: $69</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Very affordably priced at just under $70</li><li>Lightweight and compact, making it great for traveling or smaller kitchens</li><li>Still utilizes burrs for a superior quality grind and features 36 settings to choose from</li><li>Great for making just 1-2 cups at a time, especially early in the morning, as it’s so quiet</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Fits less than 1 oz of coffee beans at a time, so not suited for bulk brewing</li><li>Requires more effort and attention to use, not the most accessible option</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Save space, money and electricity with the Timemore Chestnut C2 Manual Coffee Grinder, which delivers quality performance and supports 36 grind settings for just $69.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Timemore Chestnut C2 Manual Coffee Grinder</a></p><h3>Best digital coffee grinder: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Baratza Virtuoso+ Coffee Grinder</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best digital coffee grinder</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Baratza Virtuoso+ Coffee Grinder ZCG587BLK, Black</h3></p><p>The Baratza Encore is my recommendation for most coffee enthusiasts, but some of you may want to upgrade to the Virtuoso+ Coffee Grinder. This is a great machine that has everything, and I love that the Encore has 40 grind settings and a compact frame, supplemented with a built-in digital timer that you can leave to run while you get on with other things. This grinder will automatically shut off at the designated time, so you don’t need to worry about over or under-grinding your beans. You’ll also get a slightly larger hopper that can accommodate more coffee beans at once and a shorter unit that can fit under low cabinets. Most importantly, the Virtuoso+ features stronger burrs that can achieve a finer grind of coffee, suitable for espresso-no small feat for a grinder at this price point. The Encore will be sufficient for a large number of people, but the Virtuoso+ is a worthy upgrade if you’re a fan of espresso drinks or prioritize the convenience of a machine that can run unattended.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 6.7 inches (depth) x 6.7 inches (width) x 12.6 inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Burr grinders</li><li>Material: Metal</li><li>Weight: 3.2 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 10.6 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: 40</li><li>Noise level: Medium</li><li>Price at publish: $249.95</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>The built-in digital timer lets you set it and forget it, confident you’ll only grind the right amount of coffee and no more</li><li>Stronger burrs enable an even finer grind, so espresso is possible with this model</li><li>The larger hopper accommodates more beans than Baratza’s Encore model</li><li>The compact shape takes up minimal counter space and looks pretty in the process</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Considerably more expensive than the Encore with only a couple of extra features</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you love espresso and want the quality performance associated with Baratza, then it’s worth upgrading to the Virtuoso+ Coffee Grinder for stronger burrs and a built-in digital timer.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Baratza Virtuoso+ Coffee Grinder</a></p><h3>Best splurge coffee grinder: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Fellow Ode Brew Grinder</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best splurge coffee grinder</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Fellow Ode Brew Grinder</h3></p><p>If I’m going to spend a little more, I want something that feels expensive, looks good and performs at a higher standard. With the Fellow Ode Brew Grinder, especially with its new Gen 2 Brew burrs, you get all of that in spades. The unique design is stylish and monochrome, with a surprisingly small footprint that will suit any kind of kitchen. The Ode grinder features thoughtful design details like a new load bin for smoother bean feeding, a magnetically aligned catch to keep your cup in place, and a knocker that shakes off any residual chaff neatly into said cup. The Gen 2 Brew burrs are commercial-grade, able to precisely produce grounds suitable for any kind of coarse preparation (but not espresso). Then there’s the quiet motor with automatic shut-off, which makes even early-morning brewing into a luxurious experience. Fellow has even included anti-static technology, which helps to reduce coffee ground mess. You’ll spend a few hundred dollars to get this grinder, and it may not be worth it to you, especially if you love espresso. For the extra price, you really do get a piece of luxury you can enjoy daily.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 9.4 inches (depth) x 4.1 inches (width) x 9.8 inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Burr grinders</li><li>Material: Aluminum, plastic</li><li>Weight: 4.6 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 3.5 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: 31</li><li>Noise level: Quiet</li><li>Price at publish: $345</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Really compact footprint that also looks stylish and modern in any kitchen</li><li>Very quiet even at full power, so you can use all 31 settings at any time of day</li><li>High quality materials and steel burrs to assure a quality, consistent grind</li><li>Anti-static technology and a magnetically attached cup reduces risk of mess</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The most expensive option on this list, yet doesn’t grind to espresso grade</li><li>Smaller hopper can’t grind a lot of beans at once</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Fellow Ode Brew Grinder makes every cup of coffee feel luxurious, thanks to its stylish design, commercial-grade burrs, anti-static technology and extra quiet motor.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Fellow Ode Brew Grinder</a></p><h3>Best smart coffee grinder: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Breville Smart Grinder Pro Conical Burr Grinder</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best smart coffee grinder</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Breville Smart Grinder Pro Conical Burr Grinder</h3></p><p>You don’t necessarily need your coffee grinder to be smart-capable, but the Breville Smart Grinder Pro is a great case for added technology. The LCD display is very clear to read and intuitive to use, while the Dosing IQ technology lets the grinder automatically adjust the dose when you change the grind setting. You can also save several of your favorite grind settings to the Breville Smart Grinder Pro, so that you have easy access in the future. The regular components of the coffee grinder are also up to par. There are 60 different grind settings to choose from, high quality steel burrs and an extra-large hopper that can accommodate 16 oz of coffee beans. Some users report that the Breville skews extra-fine with grinding, which is ideal for espresso lovers or drip coffee fans, but may not be ideal for those who drink French press. This is also a larger unit than some of the others on this list. Nevertheless, if you prioritize added convenience and want to get extra-fine grounds at a very affordable price, then the Breville Smart Grinder Pro is a wonderful option.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 6.25 inches (depth) x 8.5 inches (width) x 15.25 inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Burr grinder</li><li>Material: Stainless steel</li><li>Weight: 2.95 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 16 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: 60</li><li>Noise level: Loud</li><li>Price at publish: $199.95</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>The Dosing IQ technology automatically adjusts the dose to suit your grind selection</li><li>You can save several different grind settings for easy access to your favorite brews</li><li>The burrs can grind so fine that espresso-grade grounds are possible, for just $200</li><li>The extra-large hopper allows for 16 oz of beans to be ground at once</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Surprisingly hard to get coarser grounds, so not the best for French Press-style brewing</li><li>Larger in size which may not suit smaller kitchens</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Breville Smart Grinder Pro makes it easier than ever to get the grind you want, especially if your preferred brew is espresso or drip, due to its added capabilities and Dosage IQ system.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong></p><h3>Most versatile coffee grinder: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Fellow Opus Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Most versatile coffee grinder</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Fellow Opus Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</h3></p><p>If you love the look of the Fellow Ode, but aren’t willing to drop over $200, then the Opus model is a great alternative. Similarly monochrome and compact in shape, this grinder is made of plastic and offers a slightly smaller range of grind settings, hence the lower price. You’ll still get the brand’s high quality steel burrs, quiet motor, anti-static technology and magnetic catch cup. There’s also a timed auto-stop, so you can set the grinder to run and leave it to finish unattended. If you tend to make just one serving of coffee at a time, this is also a perfect grinder: The Opus is designed for single-serving brewing and does the measuring for you, which cuts out one extra step in the morning. Of course, if you like to brew coffee for a crowd or grind your beans in bulk, this may not be a benefit. Fellow says that this grinder can be used for both coarse and fine grinds, including for espresso, but some users report slightly inconsistent results at the ends of the spectrum. However, for under $200, this is a great deal on a beloved brand.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 8.7 inches (depth) x 5.1 inches (width) x 10.5 inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Burr grinder</li><li>Material: Plastic, stainless steel</li><li>Weight: 2.3 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 3.9 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: 41</li><li>Noise level: Quiet</li><li>Price at publish: $195.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>A nicer price point for the sleek, modern-looking look of Fellow products</li><li>Anti-static technology, a magnetic catch cup, and timed auto-stop for convenience</li><li>Wide range of coffee grind settings, including espresso</li><li>The single-serving design makes it easy to brew a perfect cup each morning</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The consistency of the grind is less than the Ode model</li><li>The plastic materials feel a bit cheaper</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Fellow Opus Conical Burr Coffee Grinder is a great option if you’re looking for more affordable style, a wide range of grind settings, and single-serve convenience.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Fellow Opus Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</a></p><h3>Best quiet coffee grinder: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Krups Silent Vortex Coffee and Spice Grinder</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best quiet coffee grinder</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Krups Silent Vortex Coffee and Spice Grinder with Removable Dishwasher Safe Bowl</h3></p><p>The only coffee grinder on this list with blades instead of burrs, the Krups Silent Vortex Coffee and Spice Grinder is both affordable and efficient. At under $50, this grinder actually works on coffee and other materials like spices. Instead of using grind settings to determine the resulting texture, the Krups Silent Vortex uses a single grind setting and instead uses time to determine the output. A shorter grind will result in coarse grounds, ideal for French press, while a longer grind will create finer grinds suitable for drip coffee. You’re not going to achieve espresso levels of fine, but I found that this model is still very consistent and reliable-more than you’d expect for such a low price. I also like that it’s so compact and lightweight that it could fit in any cabinet or on any countertop. It’s a great grinder for anyone still figuring out how much effort they want to put into coffee making. On top of all this, it’s very quiet when in use. Krups deploys patented technology to soften the motor’s noise, so you can grind at any time of day with confidence.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 4.3 inches (length) x 4.0 inches (width) x 8.5 inches (height)</li><li>Blade type: Blade grinder</li><li>Material: Stainless steel</li><li>Weight: 1.1 kg</li><li>Coffee bean capacity: 3 oz</li><li>Number of grind settings: 1</li><li>Noise level: Very quiet</li><li>Price at publish: $40.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>The most affordable product on this list at under $50</li><li>Very easy to use due to the single grind setting; length of time determines the output</li><li>Incredibly quiet, compact, lightweight and convenient to use-ideal for rushed mornings</li><li>Can be used on spices and other materials, not just coffee</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Blades (instead of burrs) don’t allow for as fine of a grind</li><li>Holds a small capacity of beans at a time</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For anyone new to coffee grinding, who doesn’t want to spend a lot or take up a lot of space, the Krups Silent Vortex Coffee and Spice Grinder is effective, easy and incredibly quiet to use.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Krups Silent Vortex Coffee and Spice Grinder</a></p><h2 id=how-i-selected-the-best-coffee-grinders>How I selected the best coffee grinders</h2><p>We might like our coffee in a unique, hyper-specific way, but there are universal truths about what makes for a good coffee grinder. I compiled this list using a mix of my personal first-hand experience, the opinions of industry experts, and the perspectives of thousands of customers, to determine what could truly be considered the best in the market. When assessing these experiences, there were a few key criteria that I used for every product as the hallmarks of a high quality coffee grinder.</p><h3>Grind range and consistency</h3><p>Depending on the kind of coffee you like, you will want to achieve a different degree of grind. Coarser grounds are good for French press, medium for drip and fine for espresso. However, there is a range of grind sizes within each category. The best coffee grinders will allow you to adjust and customize the grind level to your specific preference, especially if you like to make coffee in a few different ways. I looked for coffee grinders that included a wide range of settings, plus the option to save your preferred combination, if possible. You also want a coffee grinder that can deliver consistency with every use. Burr grinders tend to be more effective at this, and more expensive, while blade grinders are more affordable, but less uniform.</p><h3>Footprint</h3><p>Most people don’t want to use excess counter space for a coffee grinder, especially when it’s possible to buy pre-ground coffee. I considered the footprint of each coffee grinder and how practical it would be to add to a modern kitchen. I also thought about the height dimensions, which might impact whether the appliance could easily fit under a cabinet. Where relevant, I considered how portable the device might be and whether it would be practical to bring traveling or to a second location, like the office.</p><h3>Convenience</h3><p>A good coffee grinder should be able to convert beans into grounds in a matter of seconds, but there are a number of other features that can really enhance the grinding experience. I looked at whether the machines included built-in scales, digital capabilities, smart technology or preset grind options. If the grinder could be set to run unattended and turn off automatically. That was a big plus in my book. I also factored in whether the coffee grinders were designed to reduce mess, such as through anti-static technology, or make pouring easier. All of these details could greatly enhance the overall user experience.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-coffee-grinder>What to consider when buying coffee grinder</h2><h3>Grind capabilities</h3><p>In general, coffee experts recommend using burr style grinders, as they use a milling action to create more consistent grounds than the chopping motion of blade grinders. However, there is still a range in grinding capability once you choose your grinder type. It’s important to understand the ideal type of coffee grounds for your preferred brewing method, so that you buy a grinder that is suited to you.</p><p>The degree of grind, from coarse to fine, has a large impact on the final product. Fine grounds have a greater surface area and therefore require less time to reach peak extraction. However, they can also be prone to over-extraction, depending on the method. If you enjoy espresso, then you’ll want a grinder that can produce fine grounds. Drip coffee works best with medium grounds, while French press should be made with coarse grounds. If you like variety (see our <a rel=alternate href=#>guide to the different types of coffee</a> for more in-depth info), then you’ll want a grinder that has a wide range of settings.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Most decent coffee grinders will cost at least $100, with lots of products in the $100-$300 range that are great for most coffee lovers and offer a high quality grind. For anyone on a budget, there are a few cheaper options that are sufficient for casual coffee drinkers or people looking to try out at-home coffee grinding, although these likely won’t be quite as consistent or powerful. Manual grinders also tend to be more affordably priced, if you’re interested in that style. At the upper end of the range are the elite products, costing anywhere from $500 to thousands of dollars, which often utilize commercial-level machinery for truly superlative performance. For most people, these will be an unnecessary investment, but some coffee aficionados may decide the difference in quality is worth it.</p><h3>Size and design</h3><p>Like with any countertop appliances from the block of <a rel=alternate href=#>chefs knives</a> to the <a rel=alternate href=#>coffee makers</a>, coffee grinders come in a range of sizes and styles. While they tend to be upright in shape with a chamber on top for the beans, the height of the grinder can vary quite a bit. Depending on the amount of space you have available after putting the <a rel=alternate href=#>dinnerware set</a> and nonstick pans away, and unloading the <a rel=alternate href=#>dishwasher</a>, you may want to opt for a sleeker model with a smaller footprint, or a more squat model that can fit under low overhead cabinets. On the flip side, if you’re concerned about durability or sturdiness, then you may prefer a larger grinder that is hard to knock over and will stay in place during use. Lastly, you’ll want to consider the volume of your grinder. While most grinders make at least a little noise during use, there are a few models designed with quiet in mind, for anyone who likes to make coffee early in the morning.</p><h2 id=types-of-coffee-grinders>Types of Coffee Grinders</h2><p>There are three main types of coffee grinders that you’ll find on the market, which each serve a purpose depending on your needs.</p><h3>Burr grinders</h3><p>Burr grinders use two burrs to funnel the beans through the chamber a few at a time, grinding each one into uniformly small pieces. There is minimal heat created which helps to preserve the taste of the bean and the funneling method allows for consistent grounds, from which you can then extract flavor at an even rate. Burrs are usually made of stainless steel, sometimes ceramic, which will last a long time. Due to the higher quality construction and higher quality result, you will almost always pay more for a burr grinder than a blade grinder.</p><h3>Blade grinders</h3><p>Blade grinders feature a couple of spinning blades in a confined chamber that chop at the beans until they are in small pieces. You often load the full amount into the chamber, like you would with a food processor, and let the blades run over the material until you achieve the texture you want. This method is quick and easy and much more wallet-friendly, thanks to the basic equipment involved. However, the grounds can be inconsistent in size and the heat generated might sap some of the taste from the beans. If you’re a more casual coffee drinker, this may not be a problem, but coffee aficionados may notice the dip in quality.</p><h3>Manual grinders</h3><p>Manual grinders deploy either burrs or blades to grind the coffee beans, but they use handheld motion to do so instead of a motor. This allows for a more compact, portable design. As burrs produce higher quality coffee than blades, manual burr grinders tend to also be superior to manual blade grinders. Without the motor and larger size, manual burr grinders are much more affordable than their motorized counterparts. However, they do require more effort to run and for that reason, are often a little slower and less efficient. They may be practical for small volumes of coffee, but tricky to use for bulk grinding.</p><h2 id=do-you-really-need-a-good-burr-grinder>Do you really need a good burr grinder?</h2><p>Store-bought is fine, as any Ina Garten fan knows, but homemade is often better-especially if you can do it quickly and affordably. While you can absolutely make a good cup of coffee at home with packaged grounds, the quality is noticeably improved when you use freshly ground coffee. The best way to do this is with a good burr grinder and whole beans. As this list shows, there are many different styles of grinder at different price points that will get you the results you need, so you don’t need to spend hundreds (or thousands) of dollars on a state-of-the-art machine. However, if you do care about your coffee and want to improve the taste of your home brews with minimal effort, then a good burr grinder is the way to go.</p><h2 id=how-to-clean-a-coffee-grinder>How to clean a coffee grinder</h2><p>Coffee grinders don’t need to be thoroughly cleaned after every use, but it’s important to do routine maintenance on your machine to keep it in the best working order. As you grind coffee beans, residues from the bean (such as oils or loose grounds) can get trapped and linger inside the machine. This can turn rancid over time, impacting the taste of your coffee and damaging the effectiveness of your machinery.</p><p>The best way to clean a coffee grinder will depend on the specific model you use. In general, you’ll want to wipe down the exposed surfaces after each use and deploy any built-in technology that helps to displace trapped chaff. Some grinders will come with a soft brush or tool that you can gently insert into the chute and use to brush away any detritus. This is a good method, especially since using water or scrubbing brushes can damage the interior components. After several weeks of use, it is recommended to take the machine apart and clean the components individually, to preserve the condition of the grinder. In general, avoid using water or soap which will likely harm the motor and cause permanent damage.</p><h2 id=how-to-use-a-coffee-grinder>How to use a coffee grinder</h2><p>Simply insert the beans into the hopper, select the grind setting you want to use and then switch the motor on. Depending on the specific model, you may need to press an on/off button or turn a dial, but the result is the same. While blade grinders tend to use time as the metric for type of output, burr grinders have several grind settings that you can use to determine the final product. Once you set the grinder to your preferred ground type, the grinder will determine how long to run to achieve this. As a user, all you have to do is play around with the settings to find the best one for your needs.</p><p>Coffee beans will taste the freshest right after grinding, so many people like to only grind enough beans for the number of cups they’re looking to have at that moment. Others like to grind their coffee in batches and save time in the long run. Depending on your preference, you may need to run the grinder a few times to get the quantity you need.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Is it worth buying an expensive coffee grinder?</h3><p>We’ve included a couple of grinders on this list that cost well under $100, so you don’t need to spend a lot of money to get good quality coffee grounds at home. However, if you are a big espresso drinker, you will likely need to spend a bit more to get the level of equipment needed to achieve such a fine grind. If you want a good electric burr grinder, then you will also likely need to spend over $100 for that result. However, you definitely don’t need to spend several hundred dollars on a good coffee grinder. You might choose to spend more on a specific look or specific features, but these are optional add-ons.</p><h3>Which is better: burr or blade coffee grinders?</h3><p>Burr coffee grinders reduce the amount of heat involved in grinding, which helps to preserve the taste of the bean. They also result in a more uniform grind, which makes it much easier to control extraction levels and brew coffee in a consistent way. For most coffee lovers, burr grinders are the superior product, but you will need to pay more for this hardware. If you are more concerned about budget and less picky about consistency, then a blade grinder may be perfectly decent for your needs.</p><h3>How much should you spend on a coffee grinder?</h3><p>This will really depend on how much you care about grind adjustability, whether you prioritize drinking espresso at home and whether you want to pay more for added convenience. I’ve included two affordable options that will produce very delicious coffee, but have a couple of limitations. Then there are several high performing coffee grinders in the $100-200 range that I would highly recommend for great consistency, customization and convenience. If you are willing to spend a bit more, then there are some great models that offer useful features and a more stylish look. Ultimately, it’s really a choose-your-own-adventure, depending on what’s most important to you.</p><h3>How long should a coffee grinder last?</h3><p>If well-maintained, a good coffee grinder could last you several years, ideally between 5-10. This will vary depending on how often you use your machine, how regularly you clean it and what kind of model it is. In general, manual grinders rely on fewer components and therefore have a longer lifespan, while burr grinders maintain their quality for longer than blade grinders.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lk6Szp7HEZp6roZ6ZsrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
