He later emerged as one of the assistants who was supposedly attempting to get him out.</p><p>Demian was eliminated from the show in the quarterfinals, and returned to performing in Indonesia. In November 2017, during a live appearance on the network SCTV, he performed a “death drop” stunt. His double, Edison Wardhana, was locked in a casket held over wooden spikes.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=# class=broken_link>AGT: 7 DEATH-DEFYING ACTS THAT WENT SO HORRIBLY WRONG THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A FATALITY [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>Edison reportedly failed to escape in time, and was still in the casket when the rope was cut. It wasn’t clear how badly Edison had been injured at first, until his brother Nanda posted on Instagram that <a href=#>he had been discharged</a> from the ICU. He had apparently feared that his left leg would be paralyzed, but he ended up being able to move it.</p><p>Sources had reportedly said that Edison suffered a punctured lung and fractured spine, and that he fell into a coma.

During a press conference, he said he would take “full responsibility” for the incident.</p><p>Demian also claimed that his team had prepared for the stunt properly, although it wasn’t the first time it had gone wrong. In the AGT quarterfinals, Demian performed the death drop. However, the box failed to fall completely at the end of the act, leaving the judges confused before he reappeared. He was eliminated after this performance.</p><p>According to a<a href=#> 2019 article</a>, Edison had recovered and was back to performing with Demian, even appearing on World’s Got Talent with him.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kristen-Gray-Saundra-Michelle-Alexander-Influencer-Deported-Bali-influencer.jpg alt="Black LGBTQ Couple Deported From Bali For Doing THIS!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZqWRnLaktcCnqmarpKq7tXnDqKybpJVixKK%2FjKGmrKiZqa6ttdmem2aZlqmys3nSnJirsV2brq24jKGmsGWZqHqmsMispqdlp5a%2FpbTAp5hmnJ%2Beu6h5zaiuaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
