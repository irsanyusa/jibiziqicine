A recent&nbsp;<a href=#>Morning Consult/POLITICO survey</a>&nbsp;shows 38 percent of registered voters said D.A.R.E. has been effective,&nbsp;while 35 percent disagreed. Twenty-seven percent&nbsp;said they didn’t know or had no opinion.</p><p>The survey shows there is some data&nbsp;to back up Sessions’ anecdote, even though respondents were generally lukewarm on D.A.R.E.’s&nbsp;success. Voters aged 30-44 were the most likely of any age group to have a positive view of D.A.R.E., with 45 percent of those voters backing the&nbsp;program and 34 percent calling it ineffective. By contrast, 33 percent of voters aged 55-64 said D.A.R.E. was effective and 40 percent said it wasn’t. Support for the program was even lower among voters aged 65 and older: Twenty-six&nbsp;percent of those voters said it was effective and 34 percent said it wasn’t.</p><p>Younger voters were the most likely to take a position on the program. Only 22 percent of voters aged 18-29 and 21 percent of voters aged 30-44 said they didn’t know or had no opinion, numbers which continued to rise among voters in older age groups, peaking at 39 percent among voters 65 and older.&nbsp;The youngest voters (aged 18-29) were also the most closely split on D.A.R.E.’s&nbsp;value, with 41 percent saying it was an effective program and 37 percent disagreeing.</p><p>There was little partisan divide&nbsp;on the topic, although independents (31 percent) were less likely than Democrats (41 percent) or Republicans (40 percent) to back the program.</p><p>While the voting public is split on its effectiveness, the experts are not: They firmly argue&nbsp;that the program&nbsp;has been a waste of government resources in combating drug abuse.</p><p>“There are multiple studies that have shown that D.A.R.E. has had no meaningful long-term impact on drug abuse of any kind, including on opioid use,” said Jonathan Blanks, a research associate at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute’s Project on Criminal Justice, in&nbsp;a Thursday phone interview.</p><p><a href=#>A&nbsp;list</a> compiled by the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University contains various studies showing D.A.R.E.’s ineffectiveness over the past few decades.&nbsp;One 2009 study even found an increase in self-reported alcohol and cigarette use from D.A.R.E. participants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhbHxxg45raGiun6mys7%2BMrKeloaRixKK%2BjJ2prp%2BjYr2zu8armKZllGK%2FbrGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
