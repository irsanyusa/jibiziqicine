Here is how to know if you are now worshipping money instead of God:</p><p>You can't stop thinking about making money</p><p><a href=# id=b24e0e3b-50e2-5d5d-9af1-55d97e3d35ee>Obsession with wealth</a> is a really great way of telling if you are idolizing money. You know you are in trouble when you enter the 'make it or die trying phase.' When you are willing to do anything unGodly or illegal in pursuit of wealth, you know God has been replaced by money in your heart.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>1 Timothy 6:9–10 warns against this destructive desire saying, "Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."</p><p>Money is your source of happiness</p><p>Deuteronomy 8:18 says, "You shall remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It is never enough</p><p>The funny thing about idolizing money is that it consumes you. Rather than focusing on your creator, you spend all your time trying to make more money as the one you have is never enough.</p><p>Matthew 6:19 commands, "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal."</p><p>You are stingy</p><p>Because money is your idol, you are unable to be generous because you are constantly looking for ways to make more. Love for money leads to a desire for more, greed and makes you stingy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>1 Timothy 6:18–19 says, "Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. In this way, they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life."</p><p>You are a show-off</p><p>Godly people know that everything they have including money comes from their maker so they have no reason to be proud or show off.</p><p>Job 36:11 says, "If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment."</p><p>Money lovers, on the other hand, are constantly showing off, bragging about what they just bought or whats in their bank account.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8pLTRoqqtoZGjtrXFjKGmsGWkpHqsus6wZKKeXa68tnnWqKmsoJmleq67zZ6wZqemmr9us86dZmqsYKe0t7w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
