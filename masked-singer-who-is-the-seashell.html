New costumes, new celebrities, and a bunch of new twists have made this season one to remember already. And with a stellar outfit and voice, the Seashell stood out in Group A!</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf4xDogz430</p></figure><p>But who is the celebrity under the mask? And do we have the clues to back up our prediction? Find out all that and more below!</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-clues-on-the-masked-singer-season-5>Clues on The Masked Singer Season 5</h4><p>The first set of clues for the Seashell start with her saying she was “pulled by the tide all across the globe” when she was young. She never felt grounded, so she “found her peace by the shore.” A chameleon crawls into the picture. When her career took off, “it was like a massive tsunami of success.” She still drifted though, “wearing many hats” and is shown with a cowboy hat on.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER SEASON 5 PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><p>Seashell often wonders if she found her true calling. She is playing with a broom, which the panelists point out could be associated with a witch. Seashell claims to be “nervous” because she “hasn’t sang in a really long time” but she wants to face her fears. A bell floats across the screen before her final lines.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-more-clues-on-the-masked-singer><strong>More Clues on The Masked Singer</strong></h4><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZtthTH0yU</p>The Masked Singer Seashell clues and performance from the Season 5 Premiere</figure><p>When Seashell returned for the Wildcard Round, we got a whole new set of clues! She started by saying, “It’s been ages since I’ve been on a stage so stepping out for the first time, I was a bundle of nerves.” A daisy and camera are shown on the screen, then a black poodle dog. In the past being alone was scary for Seashell. But then, everything changed. A certain “shellman” asked her out. “He was a total jock,” she describes as one of the men in black swings a baseball bat. He made her feel “larger than life.” A stopwatch is shown stopping at 2:00. Before the clues end, we see the Seashell watering succulents and cacti with a heart over one.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-popular-guesses-for-the-masked-singer-seashell>Popular Guesses for The Masked Singer Seashell</h4><p>The panelists have guessed that the Seashell could be Sarah Jessica Parker, Anne Hathaway, Kristin Chenowith, Hilary Duff, Jessica Simpson, and Jennifer Love Hewitt. Overall, the consensus for the most part is that this is probably an actress who can sing, given the clues. Online, the most popular guesses are Mandy Moore, Tia or Tamera Mowry, and Debbie Gibson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-seashell-on-the-masked-singer>Who is the Seashell on The Masked Singer?</h2><p>The Seashell stole the show with her voice, but the clues and her nerves point to her not being a singer. So looking through all the clues, we’re predicting that the Seashell is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p><strong>Tamera Mowry!</strong></p><p>And here’s a rundown of the clues! The Cluedle-doo hint said “No two shells are the same,” which is an obvious nod to her being a twin. The bratwurst we saw is a reference to the fact that Tamera was born in Germany. HER parents were both in the military so they moved around a lot, which explains the talk about being “pulled all around.” But she finally found “peace by the shore.” Tamera Mowry lives in California so that makes sense.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FOR MORE CLUES DECODED: <a href=#>RACCOON</a> | <a href=#>RUSSIAN DOLLS</a> | <a href=#>ROBOPINE</a></strong></p><p>A chameleon is also shown at one point and Seashell says she’s worn a lot of different hats. Tamera is an actress, but also sang with her twin sister in a group called Voices. The chameleon could also be a nod to Tamera’s role playing an Evil Chameleon on “Are You Afraid of the Dark?” Seashell mentions a “tsunami of success” at first, which checks out because she starred in Sister, Sister early in her career. The broom could be an allusion to Twitches, which Tamera also starred in. Finally, the bell might be hinting at Tamera’s participation in “Sleigh Bell Stories” for The Hallmark Channel.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-more-clues-decoded>More Clues Decoded</h4><p>In the second clue package, we got more insight into just which Mowry sister this is. The black poodle-y dog could be a nod to her dog, a Shih Tzu named Milano. The hints about meeting a “total jock” check out too because Tamera is married to a former baseball player, Adam Housley. She was also born two minutes before Tia, which explains the 2:00 stopwatch. Lastly, the bagel and baking ingredients are alluding to the fact that she’s a baker and has done a “Tamera’s Family Baking” segment on The Real.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTs0YVRSzQU</p>The Masked Singer Seashell clues and performance from the Season 5 Group A Wildcard Round</figure><p>Do you agree with our prediction?
